This year's [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) is going to be hosted in Denver on May 6-9, 2024. Along with Robert Brownlee, Daniel Foley, and Paul Jozwiak I will be on a panel discussing the topic: [Migrating Thousands of Virtual Machines to OpenShift Virtualization at Ally Bank](https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum24/SessionCatalog2024/session/1700167099105001rF4Q). In this session, we will share insights from a large-scale migration project that is moving virtual machines from VMware to OpenShift Virtualization. We will discuss the reasons for the migration, the architecture and build-up of the OpenShift-based virtualization environment, the migration process, and lessons learned.

The session takes place on May 7, 11:45 a.m - 12:30 p.m in the Colorado Convention Center in Denver. If you happen to be at the session, I would enjoy meeting you.
