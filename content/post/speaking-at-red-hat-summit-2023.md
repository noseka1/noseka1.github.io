This year's [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) is going to be hosted in Boston on May 23-25, 2023. I will be presenting on the topic: [How San Diego Gas & Electric Successfully Migrated to Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS](https://events.experiences.redhat.com/widget/redhat/sum23/SessionCatalog2023/session/1673459763530001wa9h). In this presentation, I will share how I worked with SDG&E to migrate their production workloads from on-premise to the Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS. I will also cover the design and implementation of our disaster recovery strategy.

The session takes place on May 24, 11:30 a.m - 12:15 p.m in the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston. If you happen to be at the session, I would enjoy meeting you.

**Update 06/06/2023:** The session recording can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djhOSlwa7Ag).
