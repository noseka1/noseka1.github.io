Recently, we had several virtual machines hosted on OpenShift Virtualization experiencing Windows Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). In our situation, the problem was caused by a latency spike within the storage layer. To detect similar guest operating system issues in the future, we decided to utilize the OpenShift Virtualization capability to probe for the health of the the guest operating system and send a Prometheus alert in the event of an operating system crash. This article will walk you through the specifics of such a configuration.

<!--more-->

The setup for detecting a crash of the guest operating system consists of two parts. First, we activate a readiness probe for the virtual machines. Subsequently, we define a Prometheus alerting rule that triggers if a virtual machine is not in a ready state. In the next section, we will begin by creating the readiness probe.

## Creating readiness probe for virtual machine

OpenShift Virtualization includes a [guest agent ping probe](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/virtualization/monitoring#virt-define-guest-agent-ping-probe_virt-monitoring-vm-health) feature. This feature has been present since at least OpenShift 4.14, but it remains a Technology Preview in OpenShift 4.19. The guest agent ping probe regularly sends a ping request to the QEMU guest agent installed within the virtual machine. In the event of a virtual machine crash (BSOD), the guest agent will be unable to respond, resulting in a failure of the ping probe. Following multiple ping probe failures, Kubelet will update the status of the virtual machine pod to not ready.

The readiness probe must be configured individually for each virtual machine. In this section, we will demonstrate the process of activating the probe for a single virtual machine.

First, create a `readiness-probe.yaml` file that contains the definition of the probe:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
spec:
 template:
   spec:
     readinessProbe:
       guestAgentPing: {}
       initialDelaySeconds: 120
       periodSeconds: 10
       timeoutSeconds: 5
       failureThreshold: 3
       successThreshold: 3
{{< / highlight >}}

Use the above file to patch a virtual machine. Prior to executing the patch command, substitute the name of the virtual machine you are patching:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc patch vm --type merge --patch-file readiness-probe.yaml <vm_name>
{{< / highlight >}}

Verify that the patch has been applied correctly by displaying the current readiness probe configuration. Prior to executing the get command, replace the name of the virtual machine with your specific instance:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc get vm -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.readinessProbe}' <vm_name>
{{< / highlight >}}

Example command output:

{{< highlight json "linenos=table" >}}
{"failureThreshold":3,"guestAgentPing":{},"initialDelaySeconds":120,"periodSeconds":10,"successThreshold":3,"timeoutSeconds":5}
{{< / highlight >}}

Once the readiness probe has been configured, it is necessary to restart the VM for the changes to take effect. Certain modifications to the VM can be activated through live migration of the virtual machine, however, in this scenario, the update to the readiness probe will not be propagated during the live migration, thus necessitating a restart of the virtual machine. You have the option to restart the VM via the OpenShift Web Console or by using the `virtctl` command. Prior to executing the `virtctl` command, ensure that you substitute the name of the virtual machine with your specific instance:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ virtctl restart <vm_name>
{{< / highlight >}}

Note that upon restarting the VM with the readiness probe enabled, the VM will not be ready right away; it will only reach a ready state after the readiness probe succeeded. This process may take some time, in our case up to about three minutes, for the VM to become ready. To monitor the state of the VM, you may execute the command:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc get po
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
virt-launcher-windows2022-xcqrf               0/1     Running   0          84s
...
{{< / highlight >}}

After about three minutes, the VM becomes ready:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc get po
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
virt-launcher-windows2022-xcqrf               1/1     Running   0          2m43s
...
{{< / highlight >}}

You may also confirm that the configuration of the VM pod now includes the definition of the readiness probe. Prior to executing the subsequent command, substitute the name of the virtual machine pod with the name of your pod:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc get po -o yaml <vm_pod_name>
{{< / highlight >}}

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
...
   readinessProbe:
     exec:
       command:
       - virt-probe
       - --domainName
       - vms-test_windows2022
       - --timeoutSeconds
       - "5"
       - --guestAgentPing
...
{{< / highlight >}}

Following the successful configuration of the readiness probe for the virtual machine, we will proceed to test it practically in the next section.

## Testing readiness probe

You can test the readiness probe by manually initiating the Windows BSOD within your virtual machine.

Some versions of Windows automatically reboot after experiencing the the blue screen of death. We would like to turn the automatic reboot off, allowing the virtual machine to stay in a crashed state. To disable the automatic reboot, log into your Windows virtual machine and execute the following  PowerShell command:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ wmic recoveros set AutoReboot = False
{{< / highlight >}}

Restart the virtual machine for the above change to be applied. Once the restart is complete, log back into the virtual machine and initiate the BSOD by executing the following command in PowerShell:

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ taskkill /IM svchost.exe /f
{{< / highlight >}}

Upon executing the above command, you should now see the Windows BSOD:

{{< figure src="/images/posts/openshift_virt_bsod.png" >}}

In OpenShift, less than a minute thereafter, the status of the virtual machine pod should change to not ready:


{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc get po
{{< / highlight >}}

{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
virt-launcher-windows2022-xcqrf               0/1     Running   0          18m
...
{{< / highlight >}}



## Creating alerting rule

In this section, we will crete a Prometheus alerting rule that triggers if a virtual machine pod is not in a ready state. This rule needs to be defined once for each OpenShift cluster.

First, create a file `virtual-machine-pod-not-ready-alertingrule.yaml` that contains the rule definition:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
apiVersion: monitoring.openshift.io/v1
kind: AlertingRule
metadata:
 name: virtual-machine-pod-not-ready
 namespace: openshift-monitoring
spec:
 groups:
 - name: vm.rules
   rules:
   - alert: VirtualMachinePodNotReady
     expr: >-
       kube_pod_container_status_ready{pod=~"virt-launcher.*"} == 0
     for: 5m
     annotations:
       summary: Virtual machine pod is not ready
       description: >-
         Virtual machine pod {{ $labels.pod }} in namespace {{ $labels.namespace }} cannot reach ready state.
         The readiness probe is failing.  If the guest agent ping probe is utilized, the problem may be that
         the QEMU guest agent is either not installed or not operational. Additionally, it is conceivable that
         the guest operating system has experienced a crash (for instance, a Windows blue screen of death - BSOD).
     labels:
       severity: warning
{{< / highlight >}}


Next, apply the alerting rule to the OpenShift cluster:


{{< highlight shell "linenos=table" >}}
$ oc apply -f virtual-machine-pod-not-ready-alertingrule.yaml
{{< / highlight >}}


Once the rule has been applied to the cluster and if there is a VM in the cluster that crashed with the Windows BSOD, you should receive an alert:

{{< figure src="/images/posts/openshift_virt_alert.png" >}}

## Conclusion

In this blog, we utilized the capabilities of OpenShift Virtualization along with the OpenShift built-in monitoring stack to detect and notify in the event that the guest operating system crashed. We illustrated this process using a virtual machine running Windows Server 2022 as an example. Additionally, I confirmed that the same configuration functions properly for the guest operating systems Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019.

Building on the example provided in this blog post, you can use some additional shell scripting to add the readiness probe to all virtual machines within your cluster. You can also update your virtual machine templates if you would like to include the readiness probe in the definition of any new virtual machine created in the cluster.
