This year's [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/2019) is going to be hosted in Boston on May 7-9, 2019. I will be co-presenting on the topic: *Using Domain-driven Design to Reimagine Monolithic Applications in a World of Microservices*. If you are interested in hearing about how to design monolithic applications in a practical, decomposable, and agile fashion, you can come and see Eric Murphy and myself at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center on Wednesday, May 8, 10:30 a.m.-11:15 a.m. Feel free to drop by to say hi!
