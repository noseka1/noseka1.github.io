The [Cloud Native Virtual Event](https://www.redhat.com/en/events/webinar/develop-deploy-deliver-continuously), presented by Red Hat, is coming up on October 10th, 2019. As part of the Development track, I will be co-presenting on the topic: *Future-proof monolithic applications with modular design*. If you are interested in hearing Eric Murphy and myself discussing the development of highly-modular applications, you can register for the event [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/events/webinar/develop-deploy-deliver-continuously#registration). As part of our presentation, we will be demonstrating a sample Quarkus + Vert.x application that can be deployed both as a monolith or as a set of microservices while using the same code and modular design.
