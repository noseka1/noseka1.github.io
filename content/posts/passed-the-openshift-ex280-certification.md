It's been more than half a year since I started working with OpenShift. Today I successfully passed the [EX280 Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Platform-as-a-Service exam](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex280-red-hat-certificate-expertise-platform-service-exam) and earned a certificate. I'm going to share a few details about the exam in this blog post.

Similar to the RHCSA/RHCE exams that I [completed](/blog/2016/11/07/rhcsa-slash-rhce-exam-experience/) some time ago, the EX280 OpenShift exam is also purely practical. You will have to install OpenShift 3.0, configure it and deploy multiple containerized applications on it.

For preparation I used the [DO280 OpenShift Enterprise Administration](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do280-openshift-enterprise-administration) materials that were included in my [Red Hat Learning Subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription). I practiced the provided lab exercices over and over again until I gained a good confidence.

The exam took three hours and I have to say that I was very busy typing the whole time. Despite of my best effort I ran out of time with three tasks left untouched. How happy I was when I received my exam results. Passing score for the exam was 210 points. I made it through with 225 points.

I truly enjoy the Red Hat certification program and want to keep growing my collection of certificates. The list of my current certifications can be found on the [Verify a Red Hat Certified Professional](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=160-216-727) website.
