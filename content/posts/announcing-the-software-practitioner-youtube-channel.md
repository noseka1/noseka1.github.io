Hey whatâ€™s up everybody? Welcome to my channel! I launched my new YouTube channel just a week ago. In addition to my blog, YouTube is another media that I am leveraging to discuss technical topics, ideas, and projects that I am working on. Both my blog and the YouTube channel will continue to focus on software that runs on Kubernetes.

Sounds interesting? Head over to [The Software Practitioner YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6HZJ5aQc_TcXgD3kPENkQ).

The first videos are already waiting there for you to watch!

Please, add a comment to let me know what topics you would like to see covered.
