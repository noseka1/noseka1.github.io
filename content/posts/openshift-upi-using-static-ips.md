Recently, I have been working on the [openshift-auto-upi](https://github.com/noseka1/openshift-auto-upi) project, which automates UPI deployments of OpenShift.  I was looking for a way to configure OpenShift nodes with static IP addresses. After several failed attempts, I found a working approach that can be easily automated. If you prefer using static IPs over the default DHCP provisioning, please read on as I share my approach with you.
