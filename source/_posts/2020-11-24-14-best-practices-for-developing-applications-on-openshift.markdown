Over the course of this year, I have been working with several development teams that started building applications on OpenShift. My goal was to provide the developers with guidance and best practices that would help them to successfully deploy their applications to production. If you are a developer that builds applications on top of OpenShift, this blog might be of interest to you.

The blog is published at [openshift.com/blog](https://www.openshift.com/blog/14-best-practices-for-developing-applications-on-openshift).
