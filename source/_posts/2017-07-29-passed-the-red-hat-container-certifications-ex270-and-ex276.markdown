Recently I passed two Red Hat certification exams: [EX270 Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Atomic Host Container Administration](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex270-red-hat-certificate-expertise-atomic-host-container-administration) and the [EX276 Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Containerized Application Development](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex276-red-hat-certificate-expertise-containerized-application-development). I'd like to share some of my experience with you in this blog post.

As you might already know, all the Red hat certification exams are purely practical. You'll have to configure the provided virtual machines based on the list of instructions given to you in the exam.

From my experience, I can say that the scope of exams EX270 and EX276 is highly overlapping. Both exams are focused on working with Docker, concretely: creating Docker images using Dockerfiles, pulling and pushing images into Docker registries, running Docker containers, linking Docker containers, creating and sharing volumes between containers, exposing network ports. This pretty much covers the content of the EX276 exam and the major part of the EX270 exam. In addition, the exam EX270 includes several tasks related to Red Hat Atomic Host.

To prepare for the exams, I used the online courses Managing Containers with Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host (RH270R) and Containerizing Software Applications (DO276R) that are included in my [Red Hat Learning Subscription](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription). In comparison to prep materials for other exams, these materials are not that large but they covered the exam requirements well.

And how did I score? I achieved 260 points on the EX270 exam and 291 points on the EX276 exam. For both exams, the minimum passing score was 210 points and the maximum score was 300. Subjectively, I found the difficulty of the EX270 to be on par with the other Red Hat exams I did in the past. On the other hand, the EX276 appeared to me as a rather easy exam. I was able to complete all my tasks, including double-checking, 45 minutes before the exam end.

Passing these two exams concluded my [RHCA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhca) journey and earned me the Red Hat Certified Architect certificate. Here is the obligatory link to my current list of certifications on the [Verify a Red Hat Certified Professional](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=160-216-727) website.

I believe that many folks are on their way to become RHCA. How are you doing on your journey? Would you like to share your experiences with the Red Hat certification program? Please, leave your comments below.
