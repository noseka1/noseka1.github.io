This year's [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) is going to be hosted in Boston on May 10-11, 2022. I will be co-presenting along with Gregory Brown and Joe Mann on the topic: *Extending Your Application Landscape with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS*. We will discuss how we leveraged Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) to build a modern platform for applications that includes disaster recovery. The session takes place on May 11, 1:00 - 1:45 p.m at the Boston Westin, Seaport District. If you happen to be at the session, I would enjoy meeting you.
