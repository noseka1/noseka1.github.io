I will be co-presenting on the topic: <em>Using Domain-driven Design to Reimagine Monolithic Applications in a World of Microservices</em>. If you are interested in hearing about how to design monolithic applications in a practical, decomposable, and agile fashion, you can come and see Eric Murphy and myself at the Boston Convention &amp; Exhibition Center on Wednesday, May 8, 10:30 a.m.-11:15 a.m. Feel free to drop by to say hi!</p>

<p><strong> Update 05/10/2019 </strong></p>

<p>I enjoyed having the opportunity to be a co-presenter with Eric Murphy at this weekâ€™s Red Hat Summit. Discussing DDD, event storming, and why a monolithic architecture can still be the right choice despite the current push for microservices:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article I am going to show you how to attach a debugger and a VisualVM profiler to the Java application running on OpenShift. The approach described here doesn&rsquo;t make use of the <a href="https://jolokia.org/">Jolokia</a> bridge. Instead, we are going to leverage the port-forwarding feature of OpenShift.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The whole setup can be divided into three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable debug and JMX ports on the JVM</li>
<li>Set up port forwarding</li>
<li>Attach debugger and VisualVM to the forwarded ports</li>
</ol>


<p>I am going to use OpenShift v3.11 that I installed using Minishift and a test application built with Java OpenJDK 1.8. This is how the complete setup is going to look like:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/remote_debugging_of_java_applications_on_openshift.svg"></p>

<h2>Hello world application</h2>

<p>For those of you who want to follow along, let&rsquo;s set up a test application which we will use for debugging. If you already have your Java application running on OpenShift, you can jump ahead to the next section.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s deploy a Hello world application that I found on <a href="https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-openshift-s2i">GitHub</a>. This application was originally created to demonstrate how to build <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>-based microservices on OpenShift. You can get this application up and running in just two steps.</p>

<p>First, issue this command to build an S2I builder image for Vert.x applications:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vert-x3/vertx-openshift-s2i/master/vertx-s2i-all.json

</span><span class='line'>template.template.openshift.io/vertx-helloworld-maven created
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>OpenShift started the build of the builder image and you can follow the progress with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>At the end of the build process OpenShift pushed the new image into the integrated Docker registry. Next, we are going to use the builder image to build and run a sample Vert.x application:</p>

<h2>Enabling Debug and JMX ports on JVM</h2>

<p>In the following, I am going to use OpenJDK 1.8. Note that the available JVM options may vary depending on the version of Java  platform you are using.</p>

<p>To enable a remote debug port on JVM, one has to pass the following option to the JVM:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000,suspend=n</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In order to enable JMX, the following JVM options are needed:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true
</span><span class='line'>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3000
</span><span class='line'>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=3001
</span><span class='line'>-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1
</span><span class='line'>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
</span><span class='line'>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This set of options deserves a bit more explanation. By default, JMX utilizes RMI as the underlying technology for the communication between the JMX client and the remote JVM. And as a matter of fact, there are two RMI ports needed for this communication:
* RMI registry port
* RMI server port</p>

<p>At the beginning, the client connects to the RMI registry on port 3000 and looks up the connection to the RMI server. After the successful lookup, the client initiates a second connection to the RMI server. Based on our configuration, the client is going to connect to 127.0.0.1:3001. However, there&rsquo;s no RMI server running on the local machine, so what&rsquo;s the deal? As you will see in the next section, we are going to forward the local port 3001 back to the remote server.</p>

<p>Next, we need to convey our configuration options to the JVM running inside the OpenShift pod. It turns out that there exists an environment variable <code>JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS</code> that is interpreted directly by the JVM and where you can put your JVM configuration options. I recommend using this variable as there is a great chance that this variable will work no matter how deep in your wrapper scripts you are launching the JVM. Go ahead and modify the DeploymentConfig or Pod descriptor of your application in OpenShift to add the <code>JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS</code> variable. For example, you can open the DeloymentConfig for editing like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc edit dc hello-world
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&hellip; and add the <code>JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS</code> environment variable to the container section of the specification:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>...
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    spec:
</span><span class='line'>      containers:
</span><span class='line'>      - env:
</span><span class='line'>        - name: JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
</span><span class='line'>          value: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000,suspend=n
</span><span class='line'>            -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=3000
</span><span class='line'>            -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=3001 -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1
</span><span class='line'>            -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After applying the above changes, OpenShift will redeploy the application pod. At startup, JVM will print out the following line to the stderr which will show up in the container logs:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc logs dc/hello-world <span class="p">|</span> grep JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
</span><span class='line'>Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -agentlib:jdwp<span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">transport</span><span class="o">=</span>dt_socket,server<span class="o">=</span>y,address<span class="o">=</span>8000,suspend<span class="o">=</span>n -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span> -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">3000</span> -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">3001</span> -Djava.rmi.server.hostname<span class="o">=</span>127.0.0.1 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span> -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl<span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This verifies that our JVM options are in effect and the debug port and JMX ports are open. How are we going to connect to these ports? Let&rsquo;s set up port forwarding on the local machine next.</p>

<h2>Setting up port forwarding</h2>

<p>OpenShift features <a href="https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/port_forwarding.html">port forwarding</a> that allows you to connect to an arbitrary port of a pod running on OpenShift. Port forwarding doesn&rsquo;t require you to define any additional objects like Service or Route to enable it. What you need though is to start a port forwarding proxy on your local machine. Issue the following command on your local machine to start the proxy and forward the three ports 8000, 3000, and 3001 to the remote pod running on OpenShift:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc port-forward &lt;POD&gt; <span class="m">8000</span> <span class="m">3000</span> 3001
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above command, remember to replace <code>&lt;POD&gt;</code> with the name of your application pod. If everything worked well, you should see the following output :</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc port-forward hello-world-2-55zlq <span class="m">8000</span> <span class="m">3000</span> 3001
</span><span class='line'>Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8000 -&gt; 8000
</span><span class='line'>Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -&gt; 3000
</span><span class='line'>Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3001 -&gt; 3001
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the proxy keeps running on the foreground.</p>

<h2>Attaching to the JVM running on OpenShift</h2>

<p>Having our port-forwarding proxy all set, let&rsquo;s fire up a debugger and attach it to our application. Note that we instruct the debugger to connect to the localhost on port 8000. This port is in turn forwarded to the port 8000 on the JVM:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>jdb -connect com.sun.jdi.SocketAttach:hostname<span class="o">=</span>localhost,port<span class="o">=</span>8000
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the debugger attaches, you can list existing JVM threads using the <code>threads</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we were able to attach a debugger and VisualVM to the Java application running on OpenShift. We didn&rsquo;t need to deploy Jolokia proxy or create additional Service or Route objects to make our setup work. Instead, we leveraged the port-forwarding feature already available in OpenShift. The demonstrated method has additional security benefits as we are not exposing any additional ports of the application container.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed this article and was able to reproduce this setup for yourself. If you have any thoughts or questions feel free to add them to the comment section below.</p>

    <link href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2019/01/25/comparing-openapi-with-grpc/"/>
    <updated>2019-01-25T15:22:46-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2019/01/25/comparing-openapi-with-grpc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you still coding your API client libraries by hand? Is your manually maintained API documentation drifting away from what was actually implemented? You may be interested in reviewing the two popular technologies that solve this problem. In this article, we are going to look at OpenAPI and gRPC side-by-side.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Both OpenAPI and gRPC are communication technologies very much needed in the today&rsquo;s world of microservices applications. They allow you to describe your APIs using  a formal language. This description then serves as a source of truth from which you can generate the client and server code and API documentation. As there are two viable alternatives, the question is which one is going to work better for you? As I was trying to answer the same question I did some research on the Internet and came up with a comparison table. I didn&rsquo;t include every single detail, however, this table could perhaps be a good starting point for you:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Criteria </th>
<th> OpenAPI </th>
<th> gRPC </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Origins </td>
<td> <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> evolved from the <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> project. Swagger started out as a specification for documenting RESTful APIs. Later on, tools to generate client and server code and generating of test-cases were added. While the original Swagger Specification was donated to the <a href="https://linuxfoundation.org">Linux Foundation</a> and renamed the OpenAPI,  Swagger remains one of the most widely used open source tool sets for developing OpenAPIs. </td>
<td> <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> was originally developed at Google. Later on, it was donated to <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Communication Protocol </td>
<td> OpenAPI uses HTTP/1.1 protocol for transport. For the data representation, JSON is generally assumed. </td>
<td> gRPC uses HTTP/2 protocol for transport and <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol Buffers</a> as a serialization format. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> API Description Format </td>
<td> Developers describe their APIs using JSON or YAML documents that follow the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md">OpenAPI Specification</a> schema. You can find a large archive of sample OpenAPI descriptions at <a href="https://apis.guru/openapi-directory/">apis.guru/openapi-directory</a>. </td>
<td> APIs are described using <code>.proto</code> files written in a <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">Protocol Buffer Language</a>. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Description Style </td>
<td> REST APIs are described using HTTP verbs and URIs. Each URI represents a resource in your system, and the HTTP verbs represent actions you take on your resources. <br/><br/> REST APIs use <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">HTTP status codes</a> to signalize the results of the operation invocations. As the HTTP status codes were primarily meant to convey the results of the transport operations, the mapping of status codes to the results of your API functions may be a bit loose. </td>
<td> With gRPC, you can describe your API in terms of methods or procedures. However, if a lot of methods are added over time, the end result can be a complex and confusing API due to the fact that developers must understand what each method does individually. Instead, Google suggests to use a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resources">resource-oriented design</a> which applies the REST design principles to gRPC. This results in more comprehensible APIs. Also, if you intend to transcode HTTP/JSON API into gRPC, you will greatly benefit from a gRPC API designed using the resource-oriented approach. <br/><br/> gRPC offers a set of <a href="https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/codes">error codes</a> that are well suited to describe the outcome of API operations. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Client and Server Code Generation </td>
<td>  There are several tools for generating code based on the OpenAPI description. The most widely used code generation project is <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/">Swagger Codegen</a>. Other projects include <a href="https://github.com/Azure/autorest">AutoRest</a> and <a href="https://github.com/capitalone/oas-nodegen">oas-nodegen</a>. </td>
<td> gRPC comes with a modular code generator called <em>protoc</em>. Each supported language is implemented as a separate plugin. The code generator was part of the gRPC project from its inception. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Interactive Documentation </td>
<td> <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">Swagger UI</a> is a great tool to visualize your API and execute test requests against your API. </td>
<td> <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/prototools">prototools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc">protoc-gen-doc</a> can generate documentation based on your <code>.proto</code> files. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Tooling </td>
<td> <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger Tools</a>, <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>, web browsers, <a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a>, <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> </td>
<td> <a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc">Awesome gRPC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl">gRPCurl</a>. At the time of this writing, Wireshark supports gRPC only partially. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Performance </td>
<td> HTTP/1.1 protocol is a request/response protocol. When sending multiple requests over a single TCP connection, the next request can only be sent after the response to the previous request was received. This would normally result in a poor performance especially on the connections with higher latency. To increase the performance, HTTP client opens multiple TCP connections to a single server and sends multiple HTTP requests in parallel. New connections are opened as they are needed. As establishing a new TCP connection is associated with a cost, clients implement <em>connection pooling</em> to reuse the existing TCP connections. Remember to tune the clients connection pool to achieve good performance. <br/><br/> Some HTTP clients/servers may support HTTP/1.1 <em>pipelining</em>. Each HTTP request over the TCP connection may be made immediately without waiting for the previous request&rsquo;s response to return. As request responses must be returned in the order requested, this is prone to head of line blocking. <br/><br/> HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol and JSON is a text-based serialization format which hurts the performance. </td>
<td> By default HTTP/2 client opens a single TCP connection to the server and multiplexes multiple requests on this connection. Requests and responses are split into chunks and can be returned in an intermingled fashion. This prevents the head of line blocking that HTTP/1.1 pipelining may suffer from. In addition to that, the client can open multiple HTTP/2 connections to a single server and implement connection pooling. However, it is common to use a single TCP connection only. <br/><br/> HTTP/2 is a binary protocol. Also, according to <a href="https://medium.com/apis-and-digital-transformation/openapi-and-grpc-side-by-side-b6afb08f75ed">this</a> article by Tim Burks of Google, the Protocol Buffers binary format can be orders of magnitude faster to read than corresponding JSON serializations. <br/><br/> Overall, gRPC offers a better performance than OpenAPI. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Overall Summary </td>
<td> OpenAPI offers a great interoperability due to leveraging widely used HTTP/1.1 protocol and the JSON format. There is a great amount of tools available that will work with OpenAPI-based interfaces. </td>
<td> If you are looking for maximum performance, gRPC is a great choice for you. Also, HTTP/2 protocol is gradually gaining market share. Why not start using it today? </td>
</tr>

</ul>


<h2>Combining OpenAPI and gRPC</h2>

<p>Do you have to use either OpenAPI or gRPC? If you like the awesome performance offered by gRPC but still need to provide REST interfaces to the external third-party clients there is a solution for you. You can leverage one of the proxies (<a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http_filters/grpc_json_transcoder_filter">Envoy</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway">grpc-gateway</a>) that can transcode the REST interface into gRPC. If you design your gRPC interfaces in a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resources">resource-oriented</a> fashion the transcoding process is straight forward. The resulting system architecture may look like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/comparing_openapi_with_grpc.svg"></p>

<p>The third-party REST client talks to the proxy using HTTP/JSON. Client requests are transcoded on-the-fly into gRPC requests. After the requests are processed, the resulting responses are transcoded from gRPC back to HTTP/JSON and delivered to the client.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we compared the basic characteristics of OpenAPI and gRPC. OpenAPI is a great choice due to its interoperability. On the other hand, gRPC offers a better performance. However, you don&rsquo;t have to choose one or the other. You can happily combine both technologies in a single system.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this article. If you are looking into OpenAPI or gRPC I would be happy to hear about your thoughts. Please, feel free to leave your comments in the comment section below.</p>

    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/12/28/tips-for-passing-the-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-gluster-storage-administration-exam</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I passed the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex236-red-hat-certified-specialist-in-gluster-storage-administration-exam">Red Hat Certified Specialist in Gluster Storage Administration</a> exam. In this blog post, I would like to share some of my experience and exam tips with you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are two major open-source storage technologies available today: <a href="https://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> and <a href="https://www.gluster.org/">Gluster</a>. For a couple of years, I used Ceph as a provider of a block and object storage for an OpenStack cluster with great success. I was curious to learn about what Gluster has to offer. To explore Gluster, I leveraged the training materials and labs included in my <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription">Red Hat Learning Subscription</a>. Also, to give myself a particular goal to achieve, I signed up for the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Gluster Storage Administration exam. The main topics included on the exam are creating different types of Gluster volumes, volume snapshotting, exporting Gluster volumes via highly-available NFS and Samba, asynchronous replication (geo-replication), tiered volumes and transport security.</p>

<p>As I was working through the learning materials for the first time, I used the provided virtual machines to solve the lab exercises. I liked that after I completed the exercise I could run a grading script that would check my configuration and to see if anything was still missing. However, after I realized that setting up a Gluster cluster from scratch doesn&rsquo;t take much effort, I decided to spin up my own practice environment. I created three virtual machines (2 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs) on my laptop using libvirt/QEMU/KVM and installed CentOS 7 and Gluster 4.1. The software on the real exam is RHEL 7 and Gluster 3, however, it didn&rsquo;t make much difference to me. Switching to my custom practice environment removed the perceived latency while typing and allowed me to easily copy and paste between console windows. In addition to that, I could keep my virtual machines running all the time. Virtual machines in the lab environment provided by Red Hat shutdown automatically after two hours unless you bump up the timer.</p>

<p>If you are preparing for the Gluster certification exam, here are several things that are good to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The complete <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage">Red Hat Gluster Storage documentation</a> is available to you during the exam in a searchable PDF format. The Red Hat Gluster Storage Administration Guide turned out to be particularly useful. I recommend reading through the guide as a part of the preparation for the exam. You will learn where the important configuration parts are located in the guide and will be able to quickly refer to them during the exam.</li>
<li>Preparing underlying LVM volumes for Gluster bricks takes quite a bit of time which you won&rsquo;t have plenty of in the exam. Here is my advice: at the beginning of the exam, walk through the exam tasks and create all the LVM volumes that you will need up front.</li>
<li>Command <code>gluster volume set help</code> lists all the Gluster volume parameters along with their short descriptions. If you cannot remember the exact parameter name just grep through the output of this command.</li>
<li>If you cannot remember the Gluster mount options, you can find them by typing <code>man mount.glusterfs</code></li>
<li>Provisioning of LVM thin volumes is thoroughly documented in <code>man lvmthin</code></li>
<li>To list all services that you can enable on the firewall, type <code>firewall-cmd --get-services</code></li>
<li>To find out whether SELinux denied access, issue the command  <code>grep denied /var/log/audit/audit.log</code>. SELinux can provide a hint on how to possibly solve the access issue, use the command <code>sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log</code></li>
<li>To list SELinux types related to Gluster, you can type <code>strings /sys/fs/selinux/policy | grep gluster</code></li>
<li>And last but not least, you can list volumes exported by the NFS server with <code>showmount -e &lt;HOST&gt;</code>. To show volumes available on a Samba server, issue the command <code>smbclient -L &lt;HOST&gt; -U %</code></li>
</ul>


<p>And how did I do on the exam? Well, I would not say that the exam was difficult, however, I also didn&rsquo;t practice much before the exam. Unfortunately, I ran out of time before I could complete the last exam task. Overall, I achieved 236 points out of 300. As the passing score was 210, I did pass!</p>

<p>Are you preparing for the Red Hat Gluster Storage exam? I would love to hear from you! Please, leave your comments or questions in the comment section below.</p>

    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/09/24/speaking-at-the-red-hat-training-partner-and-instructor-conference</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On September 21, 2018 I spoke at the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/events/training-partner-conference-emea">Red Hat Training Partner &amp; Instructor Conference</a> in Prague, Czech Republic. Why was I invited, and what did I learn? Read on if you want to find out.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Why was I invited to speak at this conference?</h2>

<p>In this conference, Red Hat shares updates on their learning and certification programs, as well as the current status and trends. This conference is geared towards Red Hatâ€™s training partners, instructors, and Red Hat Academy representatives.</p>

<p>To date, one of my most popular blog posts has been <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/08/01/how-i-became-a-red-hat-certified-architect-in-one-year/">How I Became a Red Hat Certified Architect in One Year</a>. In this post I described my path through the Red Hat certification process, using the Red Hat Learning Subscription (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription">RHLS</a>), to achieve the Red Hat Certified Architect title. As a result of this, the conference organizers invited me to speak and give a customer testimonial about my experience.</p>

<h2>What did I talk about?</h2>

<p>I shared a little bit about my background, my personal certification path using the RHLS, offered a couple of suggestions for improvement of RHLS, and also listed reasons why I would recommend the RHLS to others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quality learning materials (concise yet complete)</li>
<li>Access to the training lab (closely resembles the exam environment)</li>
<li>Was able to learn at my own pace - flexibility</li>
<li>Designed for remote access which was much more convenient for me than attending classes</li>
<li>Cost effectiveness</li>
<li>After becoming RHCA I used RHLS to evaluate other Red Hat products</li>
</ul>


<h2>What did I learn at the conference?</h2>

<p>I learned that Red Hat builds their learning platform themselves. Additionally, changes have been made such that the proctoring of the exams will be handled directly by Red Hat, instead of leveraging a third party.</p>

<p>Red Hat has updated the score report emails to include the breakdown by topic areas. This could be especially helpful for those who were unsuccessful in their exam attempt and need more information about what to focus on before retaking the exam.</p>

<p>The Red Hat Certified Architect certification has been divided in to two different certifications, Red Hat Certified Architect in Infrastructure and Red Hat Certified Architect in Enterprise Applications. This change is well documented <a href="https://servicesblog.redhat.com/2018/08/20/red-hat-certified-architect-program-changes/">here</a>. I would like to point out that those of you who achieved the RHCA already, can log into your Red Hat account and download your certificate with the updated title.</p>

    <link href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/08/30/how-i-achieved-the-aws-associate-certifications/"/>
    <updated>2018-08-30T23:20:27-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/08/30/how-i-achieved-the-aws-associate-certifications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last year I was working towards transitioning our companyâ€™s products to the AWS cloud. I gained a solid experience with many of the AWS services, wrote lots of lines of CloudFormation code, and embraced AWS reference architectures and best practices. To round up my AWS experience I thought that accomplishing some certifications would be a good idea. In this post, I am going to share with you how I achieved the AWS associate certifications.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS certifications</a> are divided into three levels of difficulty: foundational, associate, and professional. The foundational level is optional. If you worked with AWS cloud hands-on for several months, I would recommend skipping the foundational level and start your certification path at the associate level. The associate level comes with three certification options: Solutions Architect, Developer, and SysOps Administrator. In order to achieve a specific certification, you have to pass the respective multiple-choice test. As the requirements for the three tests highly overlap, I decided to study for all three certifications at the same time.</p>

<p>AWS certification is rather popular these days. It&rsquo;s no wonder that there is an abundance of preparation materials available. So, which one should you choose? I started off by reading the three official study guides:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Official-Study/dp/1119138558">AWS Certified Solutions Architect Official Study Guide: Associate Exam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Certified-SysOps-Administrator-Official-Study/dp/1119377420">AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Official Study Guide: Associate Exam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Advanced-Networking-Official-Study-ebook/dp/B079VKD1CN">AWS Certified Advanced Networking Official Study Guide: Specialty Exam</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The three study guides are well organized and go beyond the associate exam requirements. I would recommend reading them even when you don&rsquo;t plan to get certified as they provide a good source of information about AWS in general.</p>

<p>In addition to reading the books, I made use of the AWS training courses offered by <a href="https://acloud.guru/courses?vendors=aws">A Cloud Guru</a>. I watched most of the videos from the Solutions Architect course and some of the videos from the SysOps Administrator course. I enjoyed the presentation style of Ryan Kroonenburg a lot and appreciated the practical demonstrations on AWS and the included exam tips. As I didn&rsquo;t really want to spend the time watching all the videos, I used ffmpeg to extract the audio tracks and listened to the courses while driving or being in the gym. Besides the training courses by A Cloud Guru, people also recommend the AWS courses offered by <a href="https://linuxacademy.com/amazon-web-services/courses">Linux Academy</a>.</p>

<p>Another useful prep material for the exam is the Jayendra&rsquo;s <a href="http://jayendrapatil.com/aws-certification-exam-cheat-sheet/">AWS Certification Exam Cheat Sheet</a>. It includes study notes as well as sample questions.</p>

<p>Before taking the real exam, I practiced using mock exams. You can find many of them freely available on the Internet. I also used several mock exam applications for Android:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> is a popular IT automation tool. In this article, I would like to share with you some of the useful practices we have discovered while using Ansible over the past four years.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Create a separate account for Ansible</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/ansible_logo.png" width="150" height="150"></p>

<p>In order to apply configuration changes, Ansible connects to the target machine via SSH. We prefer to create a dedicated <code>ansible</code> account on each machine managed by Ansible. This account is set up with the required <code>sudo</code> privileges. Password authentication to the <code>ansible</code> account is disabled. Instead, access is managed by adding or removing person&rsquo;s SSH public key to the <code>ansible</code> user&rsquo;s <code>authorized_keys</code> file.</p>

<p>SSH daemon logs the SSH key fingerprint that was used for authentication. That allows us to keep track of who made use of the <code>ansible</code> account. On Red Hat based distros, you can find the access logs in <code>/var/log/secure</code>. Here is a sample log message after I triggered the execution of an Ansible playbook:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>2018-06-16T19:33:02.298905-07:00 machine1 sshd[29892]: Accepted publickey for ansible from 10.0.0.253 port 54600 ssh2: RSA f4:83:34:8f:f8:7d:29:0e:40:65:b9:bc:a0:bb:eb:d0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Furthermore, any time Ansible uses <code>sudo</code> to execute a task, an additional log message is appended to the <code>/var/log/secure</code> log file on the target machine. We found that for the auditing purposes the generated logs are sufficient.</p>

<p>In the cloud, we either use custom images that already contain the <code>ansible</code> account or we create the <code>ansible</code> account on the first boot using a cloud-init script. Using a dedicated <code>ansible</code> account instead of the <code>ec2-user</code>, <code>cloud-user</code>, <code>centos</code> and other image accounts streamlines our management efforts.</p>

<h2>Report changes made on the target machine accurately</h2>

<p>When Ansible executes a playbook, it highlights all configuration changes made to the target machine while bringing it to the desired state described in the playbook. Administrator can review the reported changes to verify that they meet his expectations.  If no changes had to be made to the target machine, Ansible should report <code>changed=0</code> after the playbook execution completes.</p>

<p>When executing Ansible <code>command</code> module or <code>shell</code> module, there&rsquo;s no good way for Ansible to know whether the executed command or shell script made any changes to the target machine. Here we can help ourselves with a neat trick that I will explain on the following example.  Imagine that we want to create a new InfluxDB database:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Create a database in InfluxDB
</span><span class='line'>  shell: |
</span><span class='line'>    set -e
</span><span class='line'>    if ! influx -execute 'show databases' | grep {{ database_name }}; then
</span><span class='line'>      influx -execute 'create database {{ database_name }}'
</span><span class='line'>    fi</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above task creates a new InfluxDB database in the case that it doesn&rsquo;t already exist. The problem with the above code is that Ansible will always mark this task as changed. In order to report the change status accurately, let&rsquo;s leverage Ansible&rsquo;s <code>changed_when</code> directive:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Create a database in InfluxDB
</span><span class='line'>  shell: |
</span><span class='line'>    set -e
</span><span class='line'>    if ! influx -execute 'show databases' | grep {{ database_name }}; then
</span><span class='line'>      influx -execute 'create database {{ database_name }}'
</span><span class='line'>      echo CHANGED
</span><span class='line'>    fi
</span><span class='line'>  register: create_database
</span><span class='line'>  changed_when: create_database.stdout | search("CHANGED")</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We modified the shell script to print <code>CHANGED</code> to the standard output if and only if a new InfluxDB database has been created. Next, we captured the entire standard output of the shell script in the <code>create_database</code> variable using the Ansible&rsquo;s <code>register</code> directive. Lastly, we search the content of the <code>create_database</code> variable for the <code>CHANGED</code> keyword. If the <code>CHANGED</code> keyword is found, Ansible will mark the task as changed.</p>

<p>It would be great if Ansible would come up with a mechanism to determine whether a shell script made changes to the target machine or not. In the meanwhile, the above pattern works very well for us.</p>

<h2>Skip completed tasks</h2>

<p>Ansible playbook may be executed multiple times against the same target machine. During each run Ansible must be able to determine which tasks should be executed and which tasks should be skipped because they were already completed in the previous run. Think about the scenario where we are configuring a Docker storage. In the following code, we are invoking the <code>docker-storage-setup</code> command on the target machine:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Run the Docker storage configurator
</span><span class='line'>  command: docker-storage-setup
</span><span class='line'>  become: yes</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you would run the above command the second time, it would fail because the Docker storage has already been configured. How to ensure that the above task will run only once? Ansible&rsquo;s <code>command</code> module provides <code>creates</code> and <code>removes</code> parameters that instruct Ansible to only run the <code>command</code> task if a specific file does or doesn&rsquo;t exist on the file system. The idea is that the executed command creates or deletes these files. Could these parameters help us here? While these parameters can save you in many cases, we would like to avoid using them in this situation. Firstly, we would have to go and figure out whether the <code>docker-storage-setup</code> script creates or removes any file. Secondly, the location of the created or removed file may depend on the chosen storage driver which would demand extending our script with additional logic. And lastly, there is no guarantee that the future versions of the <code>docker-storage-setup</code> script would manipulate the same file which could cause our Ansible script to break. As an alternative, here is a pattern that a software practitioner can use in such a situation:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>- name: Check the docker_storage_initialized stamp
</span><span class='line'>  stat: path=docker_storage_initialized
</span><span class='line'>  register: storage_initialized
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>- block:
</span><span class='line'>    - name: Run the Docker storage configurator
</span><span class='line'>      command: docker-storage-setup
</span><span class='line'>      become: yes
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    - name: Create the docker_storage_initialized timestamp
</span><span class='line'>      file: path=docker_storage_initialized state=touch
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  when: not storage_initialized.stat.exists</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The gist of the above code is simple. After we have successfully configured the Docker storage we create a stamp file. Because the stamp file exists, Ansible will skip the Docker storage configuration in all the following playbook runs. The stamp file is created in a well defined location. Should we want to re-run the Docker storage configuration in the future, we can just remove the stamp file before executing the playbook.</p>

<h2>Backporting Ansible modules</h2>

<p>For the task at hand, it is always preferable to leverage a dedicated Ansible module before falling back on generic <code>command</code> or <code>shell</code> modules. In our Ansible practice, we came into situations where the Ansible module we would like to use was available only in the newer versions of Ansible or that the module in our version of Ansible was buggy. As the interface between Ansible core and the Ansible modules is pretty stable, here is my advice: just copy the desired module from the newer version of Ansible and drop it into the <code>library</code> directory next to your playbook. This <code>library</code> directory is a location where you can put your custom modules. Moreover, any custom module having the same name will override a module distributed with Ansible. This is how our <code>library</code> directory currently looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>ls -1 library
</span><span class='line'>nsupdate.py
</span><span class='line'>win_get_url.ps1
</span><span class='line'>win_get_url.py
</span><span class='line'>win_reg_stat.ps1
</span><span class='line'>win_reg_stat.py
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We are using Ansible version 2.2.1.0 which doesn&rsquo;t contain <code>nsupdate</code> and <code>win_reg_stat</code> modules. Also, we found the <code>win_get_url</code> module in version 2.2.1.0 to be buggy. Adding a handful of modules to the <code>library</code> directory avoids the need to upgrade to the next version of Ansible. From past experience we know that porting our Ansible code base to the next version of Ansible requires a considerable effort.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article, we shared some of the Ansible practices we found useful. We recommended to create a dedicated <code>ansible</code> account on each machine that is managed by Ansible. We described how to inform Ansible whether a script did or did not make any changes to the target machine. We showed you how to prevent a repeated execution of Ansible tasks by creating a custom stamp file. Lastly, we demonstrated that backporting Ansible modules is not that complicated as it may sound.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, I had the pleasure of attending Red Hat Summit 2018. It was hosted at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, May 8-10, 2018. I greatly enjoyed this conference and would like to share with you some of the interesting things I learned there.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You can view video recordings of the general sessions as well as a selection of the breakout sessions on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/redhatsummit">YouTube</a>.</p>

<h2>Major announcements</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-and-microsoft-co-develop-first-red-hat-openshift-jointly-managed-service-public-cloud">Red Hat OpenShift on Azure</a>. Red Hat and Microsoft are introducing OpenShift as a fully managed service on Azure. This brings customers the possibility to freely move workloads between their on-premise OpenShift clusters and Azure. Many of the Azure services will be accessible from within OpenShift via the Service Catalog. In the future, Windows containers will be supported alongside Linux containers. Support for Red Hat OpenShift on Azure will be provided by both Red Hat and Microsoft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-and-red-hat-join-forces-accelerate-hybrid-cloud-adoption">Red Hat and IBM working toward a hybrid cloud</a>. Red Hat and IBM are expanding their collaboration to bring together enterprise application platforms, Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Private. IBM&rsquo;s recent move to re-engineer its entire software portfolio with containers, including WebSphere, MQ Series and Db2 will allow it to make this sofware available on the hybrid cloud with IBM Cloud Private and Red Hat OpenShift serving as the common foundation.</p>

<p>Both major announcements go along with the Red Hat&rsquo;s vision of the future being the hybrid cloud. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Red Hat stands behind the hybrid cloud. In one of the general sessions, I heard Red Hat&rsquo;s Paul Cormier saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hybrid cloud is the only practical way forward.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Sessions attended</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>CoreOS and Red Hat</strong>

<ul>
<li>After Red Hat <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-coreos-expanding-its-kubernetes-and-containers-leadership">acquired</a> CoreOS in January this year, developers from both companies are busy with merging features of CoreOS Tectonic into Red Hat OpenShift. While CoreOS Tectonic was focused on operators, Red Hat OpenShift was more oriented toward developers. After the merge is completed, Red Hat OpenShift should become a product with a strong appeal to both operators and developers.</li>
<li>OpenShift console will be extended by an Admin console which is based on the Tectonic Console.</li>
<li>OpenShift is embracing the <a href="https://github.com/operator-framework">Operator Framework</a> originally developed by CoreOS. Initially, more than 60 ISVs are planning to provide certified OpenShift operators to end users.</li>
<li>Quay Enterprise is going to be rebranded to Red Hat Quay. It remains a standalone product. Customers with higher demands may prefer leveraging Red Hat Quay in place of the integrated OpenShift image registry.</li>
<li>CoreOS Container Linux and RHEL Atomic Host are going to be merged into a new container operating system called Red Hat CoreOS. Initially, Red Hat CoreOS is going to be based on RHEL 7.5, however, later on Red Hat CoreOS will be updated faster than RHEL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Next-generation tools for container technology</strong>

<ul>
<li>Dan Walsh discussed several Linux container related tools developed by his team: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o">CRI-O</a> container runtime, <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/buildah">Buildah</a>, <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/skopeo/">Skopeo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/projectatomic/libpod">Podman</a>. With a certain dose of sarcasm, Dan explained the flaws in the design of the Docker tool -  mainly the unfortunate decision to create a &ldquo;big fat&rdquo; Docker daemon. Podman is a command-line tool that reimplements the Docker functionality without the need for a Docker daemon. In the future, Podman could replace the Docker tool.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kubernetes and the platform of the future</strong>

<ul>
<li>This was a chat with Clayton Coleman (Chief Engineer for OpenShift) and Brandon Philips (previously CTO of CoreOS, acquired by Red Hat) about the future of Kubernetes and OpenShift projects.</li>
<li>Kubernetes is considered to be a new distributed operating system. &ldquo;We have a deployment target for the open-source community for multiple machines, as we had Linux as a target for a single machine&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Low-risk mono to microservices: Istio, Teiid, and Spring Boot</strong>

<ul>
<li>In this session, I learned about several open-source projects that may come in handy when moving toward a microservice architecture: <a href="http://arquillian.org/">Arquillian</a> is an integration testing framework, <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> is a service mesh, <a href="https://github.com/kiali/kiali">Kiali</a> is an Istio observability project, <a href="https://www.apicur.io/">apicurio</a> is a tool for designing RESTful APIs according to the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">OpenAPI</a> specification, <a href="http://teiid.jboss.org/">Teiid</a> is a data virtualization system.</li>
<li>If you want to release your software frequently, monolithic architecture may become a bottleneck. You can begin to break up your monolithic project into microservices to speed up the release process. If you&rsquo;ve gotten to the point where you can go faster, stop breaking things up! You don&rsquo;t want to cross the point of diminishing returns. If there is some monolith left in your project, that&rsquo;s okay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OpenShift roadmap: You won&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s next</strong>

<ul>
<li>Prometheus monitoring system is going to be integrated into OpenShift more deeply. In addition to monitoring, metrics collected by Prometheus are going to be used for container auto healing.</li>
<li>Work is underway for Open Virtual Network (OVN) to become the default OpenShift SDN in the future.</li>
<li>Red Hat is investing in the <a href="https://github.com/kubevirt">KubeVirt</a> project whose goal is to run virtual machines on Kubernetes/OpenShift.</li>
<li>Red Hat is also investing in <a href="https://openwhisk.apache.org/">Apache OpenWhisk</a>. OpenWhisk is a serverless platform allowing to run functions on Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent applications on OpenShift from prototype to production</strong>

<ul>
<li>OpenShift is entering the big data arena. This was an introductory talk about running Spark on OpenShift for machine learning. If you are interested to run data analysis on OpenShift, check out the <a href="https://radanalytics.io/">rad analytics</a> project.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/05/03/designing-a-common-build-system/"/>
    <updated>2018-05-03T21:57:40-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/05/03/designing-a-common-build-system</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code reuse belongs to the basic tenets of software development. Moreover, one should have the same principle in mind when maintaining build scripts. If you are copy-pasting Makefiles and pom.xml files from project to project, stop now and read this article! We are going to discuss how to design a common build system.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A good software practitioner avoids having huge chunks of Makefiles, pom.xml files, build.xml files or shell scripts copy-pasted all over the code base. Based on experience, copy-pasted build scripts lead to inconsistencies, build issues and are overall driving the maintenance cost high.</p>

<p>In 2010, we invested heavily in the improvements of our build infrastructure. We introduced a continuous integration server Hudson (remember the project that was later renamed to Jenkins?), added source code analysis tool Sonar (nowadays called SonarQube), embraced RPM packaging and created a set of highly reusable build scripts which we called a common build system. In the next section, I&rsquo;m going to discuss a high-level design and ideas behind the common build system.</p>

<h2>High-level overview</h2>

<p>Our build system supports Java, C++ and C development. The core of the build system comprises of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> An old-timer between build tools. In current times, writing build scripts in XML is not sexy anymore, however, we like Ant for its simplicity and power. If you cannot express the required functionality using Ant tasks, you can always defer to using an embedded JavaScript. In our Ant scripts, you could find the <code>&lt;script language="javascript"&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt;</code> element that embeds JavaScript in several places.</li>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Apache Ivy</a> Is a very flexible dependency manager that integrates with Apache Ant. While Ivy is predominantly used to manage Java jar files, we use it to manage C/C++ dependencies, too. For that, we zip up the C++ header files and push it along with the C++ shared libraries into the artifact repository.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tumbarumba/AntScriptLibrary">Ant Script Library</a> Writing Ant build scripts from scratch is time consuming. To avoid spending this effort, we embraced Ant Script Library (ASL) which is a collection of re-usable Ant scripts providing a number of pre-defined targets.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dmoulding/boilermake">Boilermake</a> Boilermake is a reusable GNU Make compatible Makefile. It uses a non-recursive strategy which avoids the many well-known pitfalls of recursive make, see also <a href="http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf">Recursive Make Considered Harmful</a>. We leverage Boilermake to compile C/C++ source code. An Ant <code>build.xml</code> wrapper script calls Boilermake when building a C/C++ module.</li>
</ul>


<p>The following diagram illustrates the organization of our code base:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/common_build_system.svg" width="600" height="600"></p>

<p>Our code base is divided up into modules. A module contains either Java or C/C++ source code required to build a library or executable. The <code>build-common</code> module is special in that it doesn&rsquo;t contain any source code to compile. Instead, it acts as a container in which we store all our reusable build scripts. The build scripts of other modules import the definitions from the <code>build-common</code> module. Due to high code reuse, the build scripts of individual modules are rather concise. The Ant statement to import the common definitions from the <code>build-common</code> module looks as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>&lt;import <span class="nv">file</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;../../Build/build-common/module.xml&quot;</span> /&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Modules are organized into Git repositories according to the functionality they implement. For instance, modules of a specific product reside in its own Git repository. Furthermore, the <code>Platform</code> repository groups together modules that implement common libraries shared across several products.</p>

<p>All artifacts exported by the individual modules (jars, shared libraries, header files) are shared between the modules via the artifact repository. If additional information needs to be shared between modules, modules can publish Java properties files into the artifact repository which other modules can fetch and import. It was important to us to avoid any direct references between modules on the file system with the exception of the reference to the <code>build-common</code> module. These direct references between modules would be less obvious than passing artifacts and extra information via the artifact repository. We like to keep a good track of the dependencies between our software modules.</p>

<h2>Module directory structure</h2>

<p>Apache Ant does not propose any particular directory structure. However, it is easier to work with modules which have a common structure. Ant Script Library embraces the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html">Standard Directory Layout</a> from Maven project and so we derive our directory structure from this standard. Here is our module directory structure in greater detail:</p>

<table>
<thead>

<h2>Common build targets</h2>

<p>We maintain a set of common Ant build targets which every module must implement:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left;"> Target name               </th>
<th style="text-align:left;"> Description                                                                </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> default                   </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Build artifacts, publish artifacts                                         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> distribute                </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Build artifacts, publish artifacts and create a distribution package       </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> all                       </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Build and test artifacts, publish artifacts, create a distribution package </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> clean                     </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Delete files generated during the build                                    </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> clean-dist                </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Delete files generated during the RPM package build                        </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> clean-all                 </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Delete all generated files                                                 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> ci-default                </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Called by CI server during the build job execution                         </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;"> report-sonar              </td>
<td style="text-align:left;"> Do statical analysis and send reports to Sonar server                      </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>These build targets constitute a well-known interface which allows developers to clean and build any module using the same Ant command. Furthermore, each module defines the <code>ci-default</code> target which is called by the Jenkins CI server when building the module. This allows us to have Jenkins build any of our modules by issuing these two commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>ant clean-all
</span><span class='line'>ant ci-default
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This two-command interface establishes a contract between modules and Jenkins and allows us to keep the Jenkins job definition fairly static. On the other hand, developers have full power to define what should happen during the build by implementing the module&rsquo;s  <code>ci-default</code> target.</p>

<p>Target <code>report-sonar</code> runs the SonarQube source code analysis tool, and sends the collected data to the SonarQube server. As the source code analysis takes some time to complete, we don&rsquo;t run it on every push to the Git repository. Instead, we scheduled a nightly Jenkins job that analyzes all the modules and uploads the collected data at once.</p>

<h2>Final remarks</h2>

<p>It has been several years since we created the common build system and we have been improving it ever since. We added many features to support our development process. We have already discussed some of them. Here is a summary of the most important capabilities we implemented so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for building Java and C/C++ code</li>
<li>Support for multiple target platforms (RHEL5, RHEL6, RHEL7, Solaris 10)</li>
<li>Packaging software as RPM, Solaris pkg, IzPack and Docker image</li>
<li>Import of test data into Oracle database before running the unit tests</li>
<li>Management of build jobs in Jenkins</li>
<li>Source code analysis using SonarQube</li>
</ul>


<p>In our company, the relentless improvement process never stops. The Ant + Ivy tools we leverage at the core of our build system are past their prime. So, what&rsquo;s next? I&rsquo;m very excited about our current progress in gradually replacing Ant + Ivy with the more modern Gradle build tool.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed the tour through the design of the common build system. I would be interested to know how you promote code reuse of the build scripts in your company. It would be great to hear about your approach. Please, feel free to leave your comments in the comment section below.</p>

    <updated>2018-04-21T22:21:04-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/04/21/booting-amazon-linux-2-on-openstack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon Linux 2 runs on OpenStack perfectly fine. There is only one glitch that you should be aware of. Amazon Linux 2 won&rsquo;t accept metadata and user data provided by OpenStack on boot. That means that you won&rsquo;t be able to SSH into the instance after it comes up. In this brief tutorial, we are going to modify the Amazon Linux 2 image to fix this problem.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>You can download Amazon Linux 2 images from <a href="https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/latest/.">https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/latest/.</a> An image suitable for OpenStack is located in the <code>kvm</code> subdirectory. I downloaded the <code>amzn2-kvm-2017.12.0.20180330-x86_64.xfs.gpt.qcow2</code> version of the image. By the time you are reading this tutorial, a newer version of the image may be available.</p>

<p>In the rest of this article, I&rsquo;m going to use my machine that is running RHEL7 to modify the Amazon Linux 2 image. First, let&#8217; download the image:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>wget https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/2017.12.0.20180330/kvm/amzn2-kvm-2017.12.0.20180330-x86_64.xfs.gpt.qcow2
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, let&rsquo;s install the <code>qemu-img</code> utility useful for manipulating qcow2 images:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo yum install qemu-img
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now we can convert the Amazon Linux 2 image from the qcow2 format to the raw format:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw amzn2-kvm-2017.12.0.20180330-x86_64.xfs.gpt.qcow2 amzn2-kvm.raw
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The previous command creates a file <code>amzn2-kvm.raw</code> in the current working directory. This file is a binary image of the virtual machine disk. We can explore it using the <code>fdisk</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>fdisk -l amzn2-kvm.raw
</span><span class='line'>Disk amzn2-kvm.raw: 26.8 GB, <span class="m">26843545600</span> bytes, <span class="m">52428800</span> sectors

</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#         Start          End    Size  Type            Name</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The output of the <code>fdisk</code> command shows that the disk contains two partitions. The size of the first partition is 25 GB and it holds a Linux filesystem. On the disk, the Linux filesystem starts at the sector number 4096. Given that the size of the sector is 512 bytes, we can tell that the Linux filesystem starts at offset 2097152 (4096 * 512) bytes from the start of the disk image. Knowing the offset of the Linux filesystem, let&rsquo;s loop mount the Linux filesystem under <code>/mnt</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo mount -o loop,offset<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">2097152</span> amzn2-kvm.raw /mnt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If everything went well, we can now take a look at the cloud-init configuration of the Amazon Linux 2 image:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo vi /mnt/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the cloud-init configuration file, you can find the data source list set as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>datasource_list: <span class="o">[</span> NoCloud, AltCloud, ConfigDrive, OVF, None <span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sadly, none of the listed data sources is available on OpenStack. OpenStack supports its own data source called <code>OpenStack</code>. Alternatively, OpenStack is compatible with the AWS data source called <code>Ec2</code>. This compatibility ensures that virtual machine images designed for EC2 will work properly on OpenStack. I would expect that the <code>Ec2</code> data source would be included in the data source list of the Amazon Linux 2 image but it is not. Let&rsquo;s add the <code>OpenStack</code> data source to the list:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>datasource_list: <span class="o">[</span> OpenStack, NoCloud, AltCloud, ConfigDrive, OVF, None <span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I put the <code>OpenStack</code> data source at the beginning of the list. You can choose to add it anywhere else. Just make sure that the <code>None</code> data source remains as the last one on the list. <code>None</code> is a fallback datasource used when no other datasources can be selected and it provides empty metadata and empty user data.</p>

<p>After you saved your changes, you can unmount the Linux filesystem:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo umount /mnt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And convert the modified image back to the qcow2 format:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 amzn2-kvm.raw amzn2-kvm.qcow2
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you can upload the modified image into the OpenStack image repository:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>openstack image create --min-disk <span class="m">25</span> --min-ram <span class="m">512</span> --container-format bare --disk-format qcow2 --file amzn2-kvm.qcow2 amzn2-kvm
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After the image upload into OpenStack has completed, you can create a test virtual machine off of this image:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>openstack server create --image amzn2-kvm --flavor m1.medium --key-name &lt;key-name&gt; --nic net-id<span class="o">=</span>&lt;net-id&gt; amzn-test
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that in the above command, you&rsquo;ll have to replace the <code>&lt;key-name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;net-id&gt;</code> placeholders with the name of your key pair and the name of the network you want your instance to be attached to. After the virtual machine has booted up, you should be able to connect to it using SSH. Note that the default user enabled on the Amazon Linux 2 image is <code>ec2-user</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

In this article, we&rsquo;re going to share the lessons learned when operating it. It took effort to tame the OpenStack beast and make it work reliably. If you want to know how we accomplished that, read on.</p>

<h2>Monitoring OpenStack using Icinga</h2>

<p>As the old sysadmin saying goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t monitor it, it&rsquo;s not in production.</p></blockquote>

<p>When looking for a tool to monitor OpenStack, we came across the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Monasca">Monasca</a> project. Monasca is a monitoring-as-a-service solution built exclusively for OpenStack. The idea of deploying a system which was from the ground up designed for OpenStack was very appealing. However, after taking a closer look at Monasca we steered away from it. Firstly, Monasca was built around Big Data technologies like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org">Apache Kafka</a> and <a href="http://storm.apache.org/">Apache Storm</a> which are a great fit for large-scale deployments. For our rather low-scale use case they seemed to be a bit too heavy. Secondly, around Kilo release it was difficult to predict how much adoption Monasca would find in the community. Instead of Monasca, we eventually decided to go with <a href="https://www.icinga.com/">Icinga</a> which is a derivate of Nagios, a de facto industry standard between monitoring solutions. I wrote about the monitoring of OpenStack using Icinga in one of my previous <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2015/11/30/monitoring-openstack-cluster-with-icinga/">posts</a>. Setting up Icinga to monitor OpenStack meant to search for Nagios plugins to check various parts of the OpenStack cluster. In addition to the standard set of plugins that comes with the Nagios distribution, we ended up using many plugins that we found on the Internet:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/mclarkson/check_diskstat">check_diskstat</a> Linux disk I/O checks, tps, read, write, avg. request size, avg. queue size and avg. wait time.</li>

</ul>


<p>Besides monitoring the availability of OpenStack services, monitoring the performance of hypervisor hosts was another important point to ensure smooth operations and user happiness. You&rsquo;ve heard about the &ldquo;noisy neighbor&rdquo; problem before, haven&rsquo;t you? Time to time it happened to us that users unknowingly started a workload that would hog the CPU, disk or network I/O of the hypervisor to the extent that other virtual machines running on the same hypervisor were slowed down. In such a situation it was important that Icinga would alert the OpenStack operator that would resolve the problem before the affected users would notice.</p>

<h2>Ceilometer metrics and events</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/ceilometer">Ceilometer</a> is an OpenStack data collection service that collects telemetry data across all OpenStack components. This telemetry data provides useful insights into the OpenStack operation and I would strongly recommend to you to deploy Ceilometer and configure it to store the telemetry data in the backend of your choice. The data provided by the Ceilometer service can be divided into two categories: measurements and events.</p>

<h3>Ceilometer measurements</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/ceilometer/pike/admin/telemetry-measurements.html">Ceilometer measurements</a> are performance data. Ceilometer collects performance samples by polling the OpenStack infrastructure elements in regular intervals. For instance, Ceilometer measures CPU, memory, disk and network usage of individual virtual machines hosted on OpenStack, it can measure the performance of hypervisor hosts and much more. It&rsquo;s up to you to choose which data interests you. We ended up collecting merely the performance data of individual virtual machines. Monitoring of hypervisor hosts was better left to Icinga.</p>

<p>There are many options of how to process the performance data generated by Ceilometer. We configured Ceilometer to send the performance samples in the <a href="https://msgpack.org">MessagePack</a> format over UDP protocol to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash</a>. Logstash in turn forwards the data to the <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a> storage. <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> is used to view and graph the performance data stored in InfluxDB. We spent quite a bit of time configuring Logstash to enrich the data coming from Ceilometer to be able to create a beautiful Grafana dashboard that would display the performance graphs of individual virtual machines hosted on OpenStack. Our OpenStack users would be able to look up their virtual machine in the Grafana dashboard based on the OpenStack project and the display name of the instance. After investing all the effort to create the dashboard the practice showed that nobody really cared about the performance monitoring of most of the virtual machines. And if we deployed a virtual machine we wanted to monitor, we preferred to just install the Icinga monitoring agent on it.</p>

<h3>Ceilometer events</h3>

<p><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/ceilometer/pike/admin/telemetry-events.html">Ceilometer events</a> represent any action made in the OpenStack system, for example: successful user authentication, creating a virtual machine, terminating a virtual machine, creating a volume, attaching a volume to a virtual machine and many others. Ceilometer generates events based on the notifications that are published by the OpenStack services on the message bus. For instance, the list of notifications published by the Nova components can be found <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/reference/notifications.html">here</a>. In the past, I wrote an <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2015/05/25/openstack-nova-notifications-subscriber/">article</a> describing how to subscribe to the Nova notifications on the RabbitMQ message bus.</p>

<p>In our OpenStack deployment, we configured Ceilometer to send events to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana</a> is used to view and search for the collected events. Having all the OpenStack events collected and archived at one place turned out to be really helpful. One day, a co-worker of mine brought up a complaint that somebody deleted his virtual machine. Deleting virtual machines of other people, who would dare that? Instead of asking around and disturbing people on the team, we were able to look up all the events pertaining to the lost virtual machine. We found out that the termination event ran on behalf of the Jenkins user. It didn&rsquo;t take much longer to identify the Jenkins job which deleted the virtual machine. Finally, it turned out that the co-worker that complained about the loss of &ldquo;his&rdquo; virtual machine was actually handed over the virtual machine only temporarily and that the machine was deleted and recreated every night by Jenkins. And I told to myself, what an <em>automated</em> world!</p>

<h2>Log collection using ELK</h2>

<p>In addition to storing Ceilometer events in Elasticsearch, we also configured <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat">Filebeat</a> to collect OpenStack logs and Linux system logs from all the OpenStack nodes and store them in Elasticsearch. They will come handy in the future when explaining other &ldquo;mysteries&rdquo; happening in our OpenStack cluster.</p>

<h2>Tempest and Rally</h2>

<p>When you deploy an OpenStack cluster, how do you verify that your cluster functions correctly? Icinga checks cover a very small subset of the OpenStack functionality. To accomplish a thorough verification of the OpenStack cluster, we started using the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/tempest/latest/">Tempest</a> project. Tempest is a battery of integration tests that are used to verify OpenStack&rsquo;s functionality and it is a part of the continuous integration pipeline of the OpenStack project. Tempest tests send requests to the OpenStack APIs and verify the responses. As the goal of the Tempest project is to verify the integration of OpenStack components during development,  the included integration tests were a bit too low-level for our use case of merely verifying that the OpenStack cluster functioned properly. However, there were no better tools available at the time and it did the trick for us.</p>

<p>After a while of using Tempest, we discovered yet another project called <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/developer/rally/">Rally</a>. Rally is a benchmarking tool that is used to measure OpenStack&rsquo;s performance and to identify performance bottlenecks. Rally builds on top of Tempest and it comes with a set of predefined scenarios that are executed against the OpenStack cluster. Example scenarios are: boot and delete server, boot server from volume, create a subnet, create and attach volume, create and delete a Heat stack, and many more. The available scenarios were just right to verify our cloud! On top of that, Rally generates beautiful reports with the overview of executed tasks and their duration. We ended up creating a cron job that schedules the Rally tests to run every two hours. The test results are monitored using Icinga which in the case of test failure sends an alert to the operator.</p>

<p>Because our OpenStack cluster was constantly exercised by the Rally tests, we were able to quickly spot resources that OpenStack didn&rsquo;t clean up properly and that were piling up. We have seen diverse OpenStack database tables growing infinitely.  We have experienced Neutron leaving processes running on the controller nodes, leaving empty network namespaces behind or filling up the <code>/var/log/neutron</code> directory with files. Remember that we experienced these issues while using the Mitaka release of OpenStack. I&rsquo;m sure that things improved since then. To address the resource leaks, we wrote custom clean-up scripts. I&rsquo;m publishing them for you to use at your own risk. You can find them on <a href="https://github.com/noseka1/openstack-periodic-cleanup">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Tracking cloud resource usage</h2>

<p>In OpenStack, we were missing some kind of reporting on resource usage. In our organization, each development team has its dedicated project in OpenStack. It is important to us to understand, how much of the cloud resources each team is consuming, i.e. how many CPU cores, memory, and volumes. In addition to per project usage, we also monitor the total resource usage across the entire cluster. In the case, that the total usage is reaching the total capacity available we can organize additional hardware ahead of time.</p>

<p>Around OpenStack Mitaka release, we didn&rsquo;t find any tool that would generate the usage reports. However, OpenStack&rsquo;s MariaDB database contains all the input data required to create such reports. It was rather straightforward to create a set of SQL scripts to generate the reports directly out of the OpenStack&rsquo;s database. We run these scripts periodically using Icinga, so that we can see the report output on our monitoring dashboard. If you are interested, you can find our OpenStack usage report scripts on <a href="https://github.com/noseka1/openstack-cloud-report">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Further notes</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to describe several further observations that we made while operating OpenStack. Once again, our experience pertains to the Mitaka release of OpenStack only. Many of the issues we stumbled upon might have been resolved in the newer releases of OpenStack.</p>

<ul>
<li>In order to get OpenStack working smoothly, you should expect to use some amount of duct tape and bubble gum. As OpenStack was implemented in Python, patching OpenStack is relatively easy. Many times I was able to find fixes for our issues on the project development branches and needed just to port them to our OpenStack version.</li>
<li>OpenStack is deployed on many nodes. It was useful for us to write Ansible scripts to automate the restart of the RabbitMQ cluster and to automate the restart of all OpenStack services on all nodes (aka restart the world). Due to the issues with the OpenStack TripleO installer in the Mitaka release, we are still forced to restart the world after adding a compute node.</li>
<li>Switching to Keystone Fernet tokens considerably reduced the load on the MariaDB database. We enabled Fernet tokens even in the Mitaka release of OpenStack.</li>
<li>RabbitMQ, Cinder Backup and several other services require higher amount of open file descriptors. For instance, RabbitMQ <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/production-checklist.html">recommends</a> to allow at least 50K of open file descriptors. Insufficient amount of file descriptors caused our RabbitMQ to crash. As RabbitMQ is the communication backbone of OpenStack, you can imagine how much fun it caused.</li>
<li>Our OpenStack networking is set up to use Neutron&rsquo;s OpenVSwitch driver and VLANs. In the default configuration, it happened to us that the multicast traffic sent by a single virtual machine flooded the entire network and caused OpenVSwitch to begin dropping packets. We didn&rsquo;t do any further research on the multicast on OpenStack topic so far, just avoided sending multicast altogether.</li>
<li>Kudos goes to the <a href="https://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> storage. We are running the old Ceph v0.94 Hammer which was able to survive emergency situations like lost storage node and running out of space condition without any problems.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we shared some of our experiences with operating OpenStack. We described the monitoring using Icinga, collecting Ceilometer metrics and events, collecting system logs using the ELK stack, verifying the OpenStack functionality with Rally and generating cloud resource usage reports.</p>

<p>OpenStack is not the easiest software to run, however, if you do your homework you will succeed. At the present time, OpenStack just works for us and brings a lot of value to the teams in our company.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to share your experience with operating OpenStack, I would love to hear from you. Please, feel free to use the comment section below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been 18 months since we deployed OpenStack cloud in our company. In this article, I would like to review our time with OpenStack and describe some of the experience we gained. Are you thinking about building an OpenStack-based cloud? This article might provide you with additional insights and tips that will help you succeed.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Right at the beginning, I&rsquo;d like to say that our company is not a cloud provider. We didn&rsquo;t build a cloud to provide a service to customers. Instead, we built a private cloud to support our engineering team in their software development efforts. Our OpenStack is running development machines, build machines and test machines. The requirements on the availability and reliability of our OpenStack cluster are therefore lower than the requirements that a public cloud would have to meet.</p>

<p>We started evaluating OpenStack around the Kilo release and ended up going with Mitaka into production. Around that time, Internet was flooded with articles criticizing the complexity of OpenStack including scary stories of companies failing their OpenStack projects. I can confirm that deploying OpenStack was a real challenge and that as we were working on it, the OpenStack version of the Kennedy&rsquo;s famous words passed through my mind several times:</p>

<blockquote><p>We choose to deploy OpenStack not because it is easy, but because it is hard.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, nothing can scare away a proficent software practitioner. Eventually, we got the job done and the invested effort did pay off.</p>

<h2>OpenStack essentials</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> is an open-source infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud platform. It&rsquo;s important to understand that OpenStack itself is only a controlling layer that relies on other software projects to provide the implementation of the underlying functionality. For instance, OpenStack can spin up virtual machines, however, you would not find any code in the OpenStack project that would actually implement a hypervisor. Instead, OpenStack integrates with an existing hypervisor software to do the job. A very popular choice of the hypervisor used along with OpenStack is <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org">KVM</a> and so when the user creates a virtual machine on OpenStack, OpenStack merely calls the KVM hypervisor to spin up the virtual machine. The same holds true for other areas of OpenStack functionality like networking and storage where OpenStack drives the underlying networking and storage software to do the actual job.</p>

<p>When planning an OpenStack cluster, you will have to choose from a variety of underlying technologies. For instance, in addition to the KVM hypervisor, OpenStack also supports Xen, VMware vSphere and Hyper-V. Most of the time you will just pick the technology you already run at your place and for which you have the staff to manage it. The freedom of choice you have with OpenStack is amazing, however, I would recommend to always look at the most popular choices first because their integration with OpenStack tends to be more solid. In our case, we chose KVM as a hypervisor, <a href="http://www.openvswitch.org/">Open vSwitch</a> as a networking implementation and <a href="https://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> to provide object and block storage.</p>

<p>OpenStack is an umbrella project under which you can find a host of projects each dealing with a different portion of the cloud functionality. The core projects that one can find installed in the majority of OpenStack deployments are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova">Nova</a>. Manages virtual machines.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron">Neutron</a>. Provides networking to virtual machines.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder">Cinder</a>. Provides block storage that can be attached to virtual machines.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Glance">Glance</a>. Stores virtual machine images.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Horizon">Horizon</a>. Web-based user interface to OpenStack services.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Keystone">Keystone</a>. Identity service.</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, project <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat">Heat</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift">Swift</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Telemetry">Ceilometer</a> are also rather popular. You can find plenty of other OpenStack projects listed on the <a href="https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator">Project navigator</a> page. When choosing OpenStack projects for your deployment, you should always consider the adoption and the maturity of the projects. Many projects on the list are still in the early stages of development and not ready for production use.</p>

<p>OpenStack was designed for massive scale deployments as you can tell if you look at the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/arch-design/design.html">OpenStack architecture diagram</a>. Each OpenStack project consists of multiple services (daemons) that can be deployed on separate physical machines allowing OpenStack to scale out. OpenStack services communicate with each other over the network using RESTful APIs. In addition, some of the projects like Nova, Neutron and Cinder chose to leverage a message broker for internal communication. The high number of services that form an OpenStack deployment contributes to its operational complexity.</p>

<h2>Getting started with OpenStack</h2>

<p>If you are new to OpenStack, a great place to start learning OpenStack is the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/">DevStack project</a>. DevStack allows you to create an all-in-one deployment of OpenStack. With DevStack you can access debug logs of individual OpenStack services as well as easily restart OpenStack services after you changed their configuration. It took me a while to figure out which configuration option affects which OpenStack service and how OpenStack services communicate with each other. I learned a lot by re-deploying DevStack many times, trying to make the individual OpenStack features work properly.</p>

<p>OpenStack is a fast moving project with two major releases per year. Especially in the past, the project documentation could not keep up with the many changes packed in each release. The documentation was outdated on many places or was missing altogether. When working with OpenStack I quickly realized that reading the OpenStack&rsquo;s Python code was necessary in order to understand how some of the configuration options worked or when troubleshooting various issues.</p>

<blockquote><p> Ability to read the OpenStack source code was required to succeed.</p></blockquote>

<p>OpenStack is written using a beautiful idiomatic Python code which was most of the time a pleasure to read. At first, I started walking through the code of simpler projects like Glance and learned the patterns that were commonly used in other OpenStack projects, too. Only later I dived deeper into the internals of Nova, the OpenStack&rsquo;s brain that schedules and creates virtual machines. When between OpenStack releases configuration options were renamed or moved to different INI file sections, I just grepped through the source code and learned about the changes avoiding any further frustration.</p>

<p>If you are getting started with OpenStack, prepare for a steep learning curve. Apart from studying the OpenStack project documentation, you will have to refer to the documentation of the technologies that you integrate with OpenStack, too. For instance, I spend quite a bit of time studying the documentation of <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">RabbitMQ</a>, <a href="https://libvirt.org/docs.html">libvirt</a>, <a href="http://docs.openvswitch.org">Open vSwitch</a>, and <a href="http://docs.ceph.com">Ceph</a>.</p>

<h2>Choosing an OpenStack distribution</h2>

<p>There are several OpenStack distributions available out there. For us the choice was pretty straight forward. As we are a Red Hat shop, we went with <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/">RDO</a> installed on top of RHEL7. I spent large amounts of time working with RDO and yeah, it was challenging, at least in its Mitaka release. For further details on our experience with OpenStack RDO, you can refer to articles: <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2016/03/27/tripleo-installer-the-good/">1</a>, <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/01/15/tripleo-installer-production-ready">2</a>. Due to the complexity of OpenStack, it is rather difficult to create a tool to manage its life-cycle and I&rsquo;m certain that further development effort will have to be spent before reaching perfection.</p>

<p>By the way, some OpenStack distributions come with a GUI-based installer. As there are dozens of configuration parameters to set during the installation, I don&rsquo;t see the point of using a graphical interface to do this. Instead, a well commented configuration file seems more desirable to me. Does the GUI-based installer enable product managers to make a check mark on their data sheet? I would say yes, but you can safely ignore it when choosing your OpenStack distribution.</p>

<h2>Choosing server hardware</h2>

<p>We started with a small OpenStack deployment comprised of 3 controller nodes, 2 compute nodes and 3 Ceph nodes. Over time, we added further nodes to meet the growing demand and ended up with the current size of the cluster being 3 controller nodes, 13 compute nodes and 7 Ceph nodes. Majority of the nodes are HP ProLiant DL360 Gen9 machines with the following hardware parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Controller nodes.</strong> 96GB RAM, 2 x 300GB SAS 10K HDD in RAID1, 1Gbit Ethernet NICs</li>
<li><strong>Compute nodes.</strong> 288GB RAM, 8 x 300GB SAS 10K HDD in RAID10 (for the OS + instance ephemeral storage), 1Gbit and 10Gbit Ethernet NICs</li>
<li><strong>Ceph nodes.</strong> 32GB RAM, 2 x 300GB SAS 10K HDD in RAID1 (for the OS), 6 x 1.2TB SAS 10K HDD (Ceph OSD storage drives), 1Gbit and 10Gbit Ethernet NICs</li>
</ul>


<p>1Gbit Ethernet NICs are used to access OpenStack APIs on the controller nodes. Compute nodes and Ceph storage nodes are interconnected using 10Gbit Ethernet. All network interfaces are bonded and connected to two different switches to avoid a single-point-of-failure. There is a dedicated 1Gbit link attached to each of the OpenStack nodes used for node management via SSH.</p>

<p>From our experience, each of the compute nodes can run up to 40-50 virtual machines using the default OpenStack RDO settings: cpu_allocation_ratio=16.0, ram_allocation_ratio=1.0 and disk_allocation_ratio=1.0. Our current limit preventing us to achieve even higher density is the amount of provisioned RAM on the nodes. In the future, we are considering adding more RAM to the compute nodes or increasing the ram_allocation_ratio.</p>

<h2>Deployment overview</h2>

<p>Finally, we are going to take a look at the high-level overview of our OpenStack deployment. In the diagram below you can see the OpenStack projects that we chose for the deployment:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/18_months_with_openstack_components.png" width="800" height="1000" title="OpenStack Components" ></p>

<p>Let me comment on some of the projects we deployed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/ironic">Ironic</a>.</strong> We deployed Ironic in order to manage baremetal machines that we use for performance testing. Performance tests are more accurate when carried out in an isolated baremetal environment than on the virtual machines that share the resources of the hypervisor. To this date we didn&rsquo;t realize this our plan but we will get back to it in the future.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/magnum">Magnum</a>.</strong> Magnum project simplifies the deployment of container orchestrators like Kubernetes, Swarm and Mesos on top of OpenStack. To accomplish this, Magnum leverages Heat templates behind the scenes and the actual provisioning is done by Heat. To be honest, we never really started using Magnum. When deploying Kubernetes, we preferred to use Heat templates provided by the Kubernetes project. This approach turned to be more straight forward than involving yet another service like Magnum. You can read about it <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2016/06/26/deploying-kubernetes-on-openstack-using-heat">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/sahara">Sahara</a>.</strong> Sahara project allows you to deploy big data frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark on top of OpenStack. We made similar experience with Sahara as we made with Magnum. We just didn&rsquo;t start using it at all. It turned out that there were already pre-existing deployment scripts provided by Hortonworks and others that it made no sense for us to use Sahara. While Hortonworks <a href="https://github.com/hortonworks/ansible-hortonworks">scripts</a> can deploy Hadoop on any of the major clouds, Sahara would be an OpenStack-only solution.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/manila">Manila</a>.</strong> While not depicted in the diagram, we also deployed OpenStack Manila. Manila is a shared file system service and we use it to provision NFS shares. Manila project started as a code copy of the Cinder project and perhaps that&rsquo;s why it was pretty stable and usable soon after its inception. I wrote an <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2016/05/22/test-driving-openstack-manila/">article</a> about Manila at the time we were evaluating it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.openstack.org/designate">Designate</a>.</strong>  Designate is a DNS as a service for OpenStack. After evaluating this project, we realized that for our simple purpose Designate was too involved. We ended up writing a Python script that dynamically registers OpenStack virtual machines with our internal DNS server. This script works reliably ever since and you can read about it in this <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2015/05/31/openstack-dynamic-dns-updates">blog post</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we described some of our experience with planning the OpenStack cloud and deploying it. In the <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/03/08/18-months-with-openstack-our-experience-part-ii/">second</a> blog post, we are going to share the lessons learned when operating OpenStack.</p>

<p>If you have battle scars from working with OpenStack, I would love to hear from you. Please, feel free to share your comments and stories in the comment section below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we&rsquo;re going to create a proof-of-concept deployment featuring a non-TLS client connecting to our cloud application. We are going to leverage the architecture approach discussed in the <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/01/10/edge-security-for-your-cloud-application-part-i">previous blog post</a>. A secure communication channel is going to be established between the client and the cloud application including mutual authentication.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Deployment overview</h2>

<p>Before we get our hands dirty, let&rsquo;s gain a better understanding of what we are trying to achieve. The diagram depicting our test deployment looks as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/edge_security_for_your_cloud_application_poc_arch.svg" width="1000" title="Architecture Overview" ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re going to spin up two virtual instances. The edge instance will host our edge service. The client instance will host the client that will be accessing our edge service. For the sake of POC, the edge service is going to be an Apache web server and we&rsquo;re going to use the curl command-line utility in place of the client. The battle-proven HAProxy is going to play the role of the client-side as well as the server-side proxy, securing the client-server communication.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>You can start off with creating two CentOS 7 instances in AWS. Choose a minimalist t2.micro instance type which is sufficient for our proof of concept. In the security groups settings, make sure that in addition to the SSH port you have also enabled access to port 443 (HTTPS) from anywhere.</p>

<p>After the instances booted up, install HAProxy on both instances:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>yum install -y haproxy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And create a directory that will hold the keys and certificates required by HAProxy:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir /etc/haproxy/ssl
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Make sure that you run the above command on both instances, too.</p>

<h2>PKI keys and certificates</h2>

<p>We are going to leverage the TLS protocol to establish a secure, mutually authenticated connection between the two proxies. TLS relies on PKI keys and certificates that we&rsquo;ll need to generate. The PKI setup for our company consists of a root CA, a layer of subordinate CAs and three end-entity certificates.</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/edge_security_for_your_cloud_application_pki.svg" width="500" height="600" title="PKI" ></p>

<p>It is a common practice to sign the end-entity certificates by one or more subordinate CAs as it prevents the necessity of revoking a root certificate in the case that an end-entity certificate is incorrectly issued or compromised.</p>

<p>In total, we are going to generate three end-entity certificates. <code>Edge Service Certificate</code> is going to be used by the reverse proxy running on the edge instance in order to authenticate itself to the clients. <code>Customer1 Client Certificate</code> and <code>Customer2 Client Certificate</code> are certificates that our company securely distributes to the tenants (customers). Each tenant uses her certificate and the associated private key to authenticate herself when accessing the cloud application.</p>

<p>A PKI certificate can be created in three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a private key.</li>
<li>Using the private key, generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).</li>
<li>Using a CA certificate along with the respective private key and the CSR, generate the certificate.</li>
</ol>


<p>An exeption from this three-step procedure is the root certificate which is self-signed.</p>

<p>In the following, we are going to generate seven certificates. All the commands are to be issued on the edge instance. Note that you can populate the certificate fields with pretty arbitrary values with one exception: the <code>Common Name</code> field of the end-entity certificates. <code>Common Name</code> of the <code>Edge Service Certificate</code> must match the DNS name of the edge instance. <code>Common Name</code> of the <code>Customer1 Client Certificate</code> and the <code>Customer2 Client Certificate</code> must match the HAProxy configuration. By inspecting the <code>Common Name</code> field, HAProxy is able to recognize which client is trying to access the cloud application and it is able to route the client request to the appropriate backend service.</p>

<h3>Company RootCA certificate</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s generate the company&rsquo;s greatest secret - the private key of the Company&rsquo;s RootCA:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>openssl genrsa -out rootca.company.example.key.pem 4096

<p>And create a self-signed RootCA certificate. Below you can see the sample input data:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>For the sake of conciseness, I shortened the console output a bit. Note that we are adding the command-line option <code>-extensions v3_ca</code> to denote this certificate as a CA certificate. Otherwise, an end-entity certificate would have been generated by default.</p>

<h3>Company SubCA certificate</h3>

<p>Next, issue the command to generate the private key of the Company&rsquo;s SubCA:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>openssl genrsa -out subca.company.example.key.pem 4096

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>systemctl start httpd
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The default static web page served by Apache is for our purposes a bit too long. Let&rsquo;s replace it with a simple, one line message:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;It works!&#39;</span> &gt; /var/www/html/index.html
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To verify that Apache was installed properly and is running, issue the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl localhost
</span><span class='line'>It works!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Configuring the reverse proxy on the edge instance</h2>

<p>In this section, we are going to set up the reverse proxy on the edge instance. First, let&rsquo;s prepare two files which will be referred to from the HAProxy configuration. The file <code>app.crt</code> will include the edge service certificate along with the CA chain and the respective private key. It is used by HAProxy to authenticate itself to the clients. In the following sections, we will configure the client-side HAProxy to trust these certificates and hence verify that it is connecting to the correct service and not for example to a service of an attacker. To create the <code>app.crt</code> file, you can type:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cat <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>app.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>subca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>rootca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>app.company.example.key.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>&gt; /etc/haproxy/ssl/app.crt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The important task of the server-side HAProxy is to authenticate the incoming client connections. In our project, we are looking at two customers that should be allowed to access our application. For that, we&rsquo;re going to include the CA certificate chains of the two customers into the <code>customer-ca.crt</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cat <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>subca.customer1.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>subca.customer2.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>rootca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>&gt; /etc/haproxy/ssl/customer-ca.crt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As the last step in this section, we are going to configure HAProxy. You can open the HAProxy configuration file <code>/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg</code> in your favorite editor and replace its content with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  mode http
</span><span class='line'>  server customer2 127.0.0.1:80 check
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a minimalist configuration file, good enough for our proof of concept. HAProxy is going to listen on port 443 for incoming TLS connections. It will present the edge service certificate to the clients. At the same time, it will only accept connections from the clients sending the Customer1 or Customer2 certificate. Based on the <code>Common Name</code> field of the client&rsquo;s certificate, HAProxy will forward the request to the respective backend. In our case, both customers will be served by the same service listening on 127.0.0.1:80, however, you can imagine that in the real scenario there would be two separate edge services perhaps running on two different machines.</p>

<p>You can start the HAProxy service using the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>systemctl restart haproxy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before moving on, check the HAProxy logs. If everything worked well, there should be no errors or warnings:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>journalctl -u haproxy -e
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Configuring the proxy on the client instance</h2>

<p>In this section, we&rsquo;re going to turn our attention to the client instance. First, we&rsquo;ll need to copy some of the PKI keys and certificates from the edge instance to the client instance. I configured SSH between the two instances, so that I can issue the following command on the edge instance to copy the files to the client instance:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>scp <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>customer1.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>customer1.example.key.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>customer2.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>customer2.example.key.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>subca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>rootca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>ip-172-31-33-109.us-west-2.compute.internal:
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In the above command, make sure that you replace the target host name <code>ip-172-31-33-109.us-west-2.compute.internal</code> with the DNS name of your client instance.</p>

<p>On the client instance, we are going to add a line to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file which will make the DNS name <code>app.company.example</code> resolve to the IP address of the edge instance. In the following command, replace the IP address with the IP address of your edge instance:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo </span>172.31.44.105 app.company.example &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s check that the TLS client is able to connect to the edge service. On the client instance, type:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--cacert rootca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--cert ./customer1.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--key ./customer1.example.key.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>https://app.company.example
</span><span class='line'>It works!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Excellent! We&rsquo;ve just verified that the client with the built-in TLS support is able to successfully connect to our edge service and authenticate itself as Customer1.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this tutorial was to allow a client without TLS support to access the edge service, too. In order to achieve this goal, we&rsquo;re going to set up a client-side HAProxy. First, let&rsquo;s prepare two files that will be needed by HAProxy. The <code>customer1.crt</code> file enables HAProxy to authenticate itself to the edge service as Customer1. You can create this file by issuing the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cat <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>customer1.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>customer1.example.key.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>&gt; /etc/haproxy/ssl/customer1.crt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Second file allows HAProxy to verify the authenticity of the edge service. It includes a chain of CA certificates, against which the certificate presented by the edge service will be verified. You can create the <code>company-ca.crt</code> file using the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>cat <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>subca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>rootca.company.example.crt.pem <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>&gt; /etc/haproxy/ssl/company-ca.crt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And finally, we are going to configure the client-side HAProxy. On the client instance, open the file <code>/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg</code>  in your favorite editor and replace its content with the following configuration:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>HAProxy will listen on port 80 for the incoming HTTP connections. For each HTTP connection it will open a secure HTTPS connection to the edge service and it will pass the data back and forth between the two connections. You can start the HAProxy on the client instance by typing:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>systemctl restart haproxy
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Double-check that there are no warnings or errors in the HAProxy logs:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>journalctl -u haproxy -e
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If everything went well, you should be able to connect to the edge service using a non-TLS client. Here we go:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl localhost
</span><span class='line'>It works!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To verify that our client is recognized by the cloud application as Customer1, you can comment out the line <code>use_backend edge_customer1 if ...</code> in the <code>/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg</code> file on the edge instance. Remember to restart HAProxy after you modified the configuration. The repeated test from the client instance proves that indeed there&rsquo;s no backend for the Customer1 available anymore:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl localhost
</span><span class='line'>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;503 Service Unavailable&lt;/h1&gt;
</span><span class='line'>No server is available to handle this request.
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Conclusion and final remarks</h2>

<p>In this blog post, we established a secure communication channel between the client and our application running in the cloud. As demonstrated, our approach is also suitable for client applications that don&rsquo;t support TLS.</p>

<p>In our example, the client certificate authentication was carried out by HAProxy and the edge service sitting behind the proxy didn&rsquo;t get any information about the client. To improve the design, HAProxy could be configured to forward the attributes of the certificate presented by the client to the backend, by setting them as HTTP request headers. HAProxy even allows to insert the entire client certificate into a request header for the backend.</p>

<p>Our server presented a certificate that was signed by our own CA. In practice, we would deploy a certificate signed by a trusted third-party CA. AWS provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager">AWS Certificate Manager</a> (ACM) service to generate certificates for ELBs, API Gateway and other AWS services. Unfortunately, we cannot utilize this service for our use case as it doesn&rsquo;t provide access to the private key. Instead, we can purchase a certificate from one of the trusted certificate authorities or leverage the free of charge <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a> certificate authority.</p>

<p>This concludes our miniseries about edge security for cloud applications. We are still evaluating the proposed approach. What do you think about it? If you have any feedback, please, feel free to add your comments in the comment section below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When designing a cloud application, one of the challenges you need to tackle is the secure communication of your clients with your servers over the public Internet. In this post, I&rsquo;m going to sketch a system architecture that allows you to authenticate the clients and exchange data between your clients and servers securely. The proposed architecture is also suitable when migrating an existing application, which didn&rsquo;t implement the secure communication, to the cloud.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In this article, we are going to assume that we&rsquo;re dealing with a multi-tenant cloud application whose architecture follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA</a> architecture principles. The application consists of several edge services that accept the incoming client requests. After validating the incoming request, the request is passed to the backend services for processing. Here is a diagram depicting such an application:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/edge_security_for_your_cloud_application_soa.svg" width="800" height="1000" title="SOA architecture" ></p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Before we start walking through the design, let&rsquo;s take a look at the set of requirements that drove the design decisions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>One of the first steps of request validation should be the client authentication. Requests originating from the clients that fail to authenticate should be refused immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>We don&rsquo;t impose any restrictions on what protocol is used by the clients to communicate with our application. Typically, clients will leverage the HTTP protocol but we want to support any TCP based protocol. In other words, our application doesn&rsquo;t have to be a web service.</p></li>
<li><p>From the past, we inherited some clients that are not able to communicate in a secure way. For instance, they are only able to talk plain HTTP and don&rsquo;t support HTTPS. We would like to make such clients work with our application without the need to modify the clients themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>And last but not least, we would like to avoid the need to establish a VPN connection between the client machine and the cloud. In practice, setting up a VPN connection requires quite invasive configuration of the client operating system. For our application tenants (our customers) this would impose a barrier that would hurt the adoption of our cloud application. Something we definitely don&rsquo;t want.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>The edge layer</h2>

<p>SSL/TLS is a family of security protocols that many VPNs rely upon. Currently, the TLS protocol is considered to be one of the strongest and most mature security protocols available. It was a clear choice for us to leverage the TLS protocol for communication between the clients and servers including the mutual authentication using PKI certificates. Finally, here is a diagram showing the edge layer of our cloud application in detail:</p>

<p><img src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/edge_security_for_your_cloud_application_server.svg" width="800" height="1000" title="The edge layer" ></p>

<h2>Internet-facing ELB</h2>

<p>Interestingly, AWS Elastic load balancers don&rsquo;t support client certificate authentication. Both, Classic load balancer and Application load balancer, support TLS offloading where they can terminate the TLS connection for you. However, they are not able to authenticate the client certificate and they also don&rsquo;t allow forwarding the certificate details to the backend application which could carry out the authentication by itself. In order to implement the client certificate authentication, you are pretty much left with two options: you can either use the Classic load balancer in the TCP mode, or you can employ the Network load balancer which operates on the TCP level. In both cases, the Elastic load balancer just passes the TLS connection through to your EC2 instances where you have to terminate and authenticate the TLS connection yourself. As the connection between ELB and the EC2 instances remains encrypted, you are gaining a plus from the security standpoint, too.</p>

<p>While ELB doesn&rsquo;t authenticate clients, it plays an important role in our architecture. First, ELB is highly-available and distributes the traffic to several edge instances that are not highly-available. Second, ELB implements a layer 3 (e.g. UDP reflection) and layer 4 (e.g. SYN flood) DDOS attack protection.</p>

<p>Btw., Amazon API Gateway doesn&rsquo;t support client certificate authentication either and so is less helpful for our scenario.</p>

<h2>Reverse proxy on edge instances</h2>

<p>Depending on your architecture, your edge services may or may not have a support for accepting TLS connections built in. I personally see the connection security to be a job for the infrastructure and would vote against implementing the TLS support in your application services. Here are some concrete arguments why to terminate the TLS connection outside of your application services:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your application services may be written in different languages. For each language and its runtime, the TLS configuration is different. You don&rsquo;t want to spend your time figuring out, how to configure TLS on Apache Tomcat, Eclipse Jetty, Apache server, Node.js and others, do you? Different technologies support different TLS features. For example, TLS SNI is supported only in Tomcat >= 8.5. Researching the supported feature set of every runtime is time consuming.</p></li>
<li><p>The proxy provides a good place to monitor and log what&rsquo;s going on on the wire. Remember that ELB won&rsquo;t have any insight into your traffic as the traffic is TLS encrypted.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to automate the TLS certificate rotation and revocation. You&rsquo;ll have to implement this for all your different web servers. That&rsquo;s quite a bit of work.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Instead of handling TLS in your application services, I would recommend deploying a reverse proxy in front of your services. This proxy will terminate the incoming TLS connection. This will allow you to manage all the TLS related settings in one place. The battle-tested proxies like <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> or <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> can authenticate the client certificate against a trusted certificate authority. They can also forward the certificate details to your edge service which can implement a more complex authentication logic if you need it.</p>

<p>You should deploy the reverse proxy on the same instance with your edge service. This way, the decrypted communication between the proxy and your service will never leave the instance. In order to capture the decrypted traffic, one would need to have a root access on the instance. The possibility to capture the communication in the clear will come handy when troubleshooting, though.</p>

<h2>The client side</h2>

<p>After discussing the server-side design, let&rsquo;s talk about the client-side part of the picture. As we mentioned in the requirements section above, our architecture has to also support clients that don&rsquo;t have the TLS functionality built in. In turns out that there are actually three different client types:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clients with native TLS mutual authentication support</li>
<li>Clients with no TLS support at all</li>
<li>Clients supporting TLS with one-way authentication only, i.e. the client is able to authenticate the server certificate but it doesn&rsquo;t present its own certificate to the server.</li>
</ol>


<p>There is nothing special to do for the clients with native TLS mutual authentication support. They can directly connect to the application servers. To ensure the secure communication for the remaining two client types, we&rsquo;re going to deploy a proxy on the client machines. This proxy will enforce the TLS mutually authenticated connection over the Internet. A diagram depicting the three client types looks as follows:</p>

<p>In the case number two, the proxy is configured in the SSL/TLS encryption mode. It accepts an unencrypted connection from the client and forwards the communication over a TLS encrypted channel to the server.  For the case number three, the proxy must be configured using the SSL/TLS bridging aka re-encryption mode. The proxy accepts an encrypted connection from the client, creates a separate encrypted connection to the server and passes the data between the two connections. Both HAProxy and Nginx support these configuration modes. You can also refer to the TLS layouts described in the HAProxy <a href="https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/aloha/7-0/deployment-guides/tls-layouts/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, as a proxy one could also employ <a href="https://www.stunnel.org">stunnel</a>. Before the SSL/TLS support was built into HAProxy, stunnel used to be deployed along with HAProxy to provide the SSL/TLS functionality. To accomplish the case number three using stunnel, one would actually need to combine two stunnels in series.</p>

<p>Recently, a modern <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> proxy emerged and I would like to encourage you to check it out. It provides a really impressive set of features that goes far beyond the load balancing functionality: automatic retries, circuit breaking, zone local load balancing, very detailed metrics etc. Envoy helps to solve several networking problems common to the cloud-native applications. In our proposed architecture, Envoy would be deployed in the role of an edge proxy on the server side as well as in the role of the service proxy on the client side.</p>

<p>Whichever proxy you choose on the client-side, remember to deploy it in a highly available fashion. You don&rsquo;t want to introduce a single point of failure into your system, do you?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we walked through the secure edge design explaining the reasoning behind the individual design decisions. In the <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2018/01/12/edge-security-for-your-cloud-application-part-ii">second blog post</a> of this miniseries, we&rsquo;re going to demonstrate a practical implementation of our approach using HAProxy.</p>

<h2>Keynotes</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keynote: A Community of Builders</strong>

<ul>
<li>Linux Foundation created a <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-kubernetes-linuxfoundationx-lfs158x">Introduction to Kubernetes</a> course available to everybody who wants to learn Kubernetes. The course is provided free of charge on the edX platform.</li>
<li>CNCF in collaboration with The Linux Foundation created a certification program <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/">Certified Kubernetes Administrator</a> (CKA). Check it out, if you want to demonstrate your Kubernetes skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Keynote: CNCF Project Updates</strong>

<ul>
<li>The recently released <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a> v1.0 is going to replace <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/dns">Kube DNS</a> in Kubernetes v1.9.</li>
<li>Container runtime <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a>, originally created by Docker and now hosted by CNCF, reached its v1.0 milestone.</li>
<li>Today, the CNCF logging project <a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">Fluentd</a> reached its v1.0 release.</li>
<li>A rather young project <a href="http://fluentbit.io/">Fluent Bit</a> is a log forwarder which allows you to collect your data/logs from various sources and forward them to multiple destinations. Supported destinations are among others: Elasticsearch, InfluxDB or Kafka. Fluent Bit is implemented in C and it only leverages asynchronous operations to collect and deliver data. It integrates well with the <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> monitoring system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Keynote: Cloud Native at AWS</strong>

<ul>
<li>AWS chose containerd as the runtime for their managed Kubernetes service <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">EKS</a>.</li>
<li>With the recent announcements of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/announcing-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-preview/">Amazon EC2 Bare Metal instances</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-container-service-for-kubernetes/">Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes</a>, there are now four first-class deployment entities available on AWS: bare metal, VMs, containers and functions.</li>
<li>Amazon ECS for Kubernetes will leverage IAM to authenticate identities and the Kubernetes&#8217; RBAC for authorization. Pods will be assigned IAM roles in order for them to be able to talk to other AWS services, e.g. S3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Sessions attended</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Embedding the Containerd Runtime for Fun and Profit</strong>

<ul>
<li>ShiftFS is trying to solve the problem with the access (uid/gid) to a single file system from two containers running in different user namespaces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Kata Containers: Hypervisor-Based Container Runtime</strong>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://katacontainers.io/">Kata Containers</a> project is a merger of two projects: <a href="https://github.com/clearcontainers/runtime">Intel Clear Containers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperhq/runv">Hyper runV</a>. The goal of the project is to create a container runtime that would run containers as virtual machines, however, with the speed comparable to the namespace-based containers. This would allow to bring the secure hypervisor-based isolation to containers.</li>
<li>Kata Containers would provide an alternative to the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> runtime which is used by the namespace-based containers. In the Kubernetes cluster, both namespace-based as well as hypervisor-based containers could run at the same time.</li>
<li>On Kubernetes, a Kubernetes pod would be implemented as a single VM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Building Specialized Container-Based Systems with Moby: A Few Use Cases</strong>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2017/04/introducing-the-moby-project/">Moby project</a> is pretty much an umbrella for all Docker open-source projects. Projects like <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit">LinuxKit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docker/infrakit">InfraKit</a>, and many more are part of the Moby project. From the components of the Moby project, Docker company builds their Docker SE product, from which the Docker EE product is derived. Moby project is governed by the Technical Steering Committee (<a href="https://github.com/moby/tsc">TSC</a>). In times before the TSC was established, technical disputes were resolved by the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) which was Solomon Hykes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit">LinuxKit</a> is a toolkit for building custom Linux images. The single purpose of these images is to run containerized applications. When creating an image, you can choose a Linux kernel, choose a container runtime and pick additional services that should be started on boot. If the basic containerd runtime doesn&rsquo;t suit you, LinuxKit can even install Kubernetes for you. Resulting images include only packages that you&rsquo;ve chosen and nothing else, hence reducing the attack surface and improving security. You can spin AWS instances off of your customized images and start scheduling containerized applications on them. Instances are considered immutable. In order to apply software updates, you must build a new version of the image and replace the instances running the old image.</li>
<li>In order to simplify the managing of the infrastructure running on top of immutable images (built with LinuxKit), Docker came up with another toolkit called <a href="https://github.com/docker/infrakit.git">InfraKit</a>. InfraKit allows you to create and manage clustered infrastructure like Swarm or Kubernetes clusters. Docker&rsquo;s motivation behind InfraKit was the deployment and management of their Docker SE and Docker EE products. Behind the scenes, InfraKit leverages Terraform for resource provisioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CRI-O: All the Runtime Kubernetes Needs and Nothing More</strong>

<ul>
<li>Container runtime containerd originally developed by Docker Inc. is used for various purposes. Besides Kubernetes and OpenShift, containerd powers Swarm clusters and the recently announced Amazon EKS is also going to leverage containerd. Being a general purpose runtime, containerd suffered from compatibility issues with Kubernetes, where an update of containerd would break the Kubernetes cluster. For the sake of stability and <a href="http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2017/06/6-reasons-why-cri-o-is-the-best-runtime-for-kubernetes/">several other reasons</a>, Red Hat initiated a project <a href="http://cri-o.io/">CRI-O</a> which aims to create an alternative runtime that would be dedicated to Kubernetes only. CRI-O is available for testing in OpenShift 3.7 and it is going to ship as the default container runtime in the future OpenShift releases, replacing containerd.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Extending Kubernetes 101</strong>

<ul>
<li>Kubernetes can be extended by implementing a custom controller also called <em>operator</em>.</li>
<li>This controller runs as a pod on Kubernetes cluster. On startup, custom controller is supposed to register one or more custom resources with Kubernetes. After that, the controller watches the changes in the desired state of custom resources and acts upon them.</li>
<li>The concept of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/">Custom Resources</a> is supported by Kubernetes since version 1.7.</li>
<li>Custom resources are designed to feel like native Kubernetes resources. They are exposed as another API along with the native APIs. The kubectl client can discover and work with custom resources right away.</li>
<li>Using the kubectl, user can change the desired state of custom resources (add, update, delete). The custom controller that watches the desired state of the custom resources will carry on operations required to reach the desired state.</li>
<li>Btw., there&rsquo;s a generator available that speeds up the implementation of operators.</li>
<li>See also <a href="https://github.com/rook/operator-kit">Kubernetes Operator Kit</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Certifik8ts: All You Need to Know about Certificates in Kubernetes</strong>

<ul>
<li>As of Kubernetes 1.8, the Kubelet can request a new client certificate when the current one is nearing its expiration.</li>
<li>Currently, Kubernetes cannot revoke certificates. This is good to know if you use client certificates to athenticate users. Once you issue a client certificate to the user, you won&rsquo;t be able to revoke it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Istio: Saling to a Secure Services Mesh</strong>

<ul>
<li>Service mesh acts as a proxy on the communication path between your microservices. As a proxy, service mesh adds a host of useful functionality that you would otherwise have to implement yourself in your microservices: secure communication, traffic routing, load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breakers, timeouts and retries, metrics, reporting, etc.</li>
<li>Somebody on the conference has noted, that the year 2018 will be the year of the service mesh. Based on how many problems the service mesh can solve for distributed microservices, I can only agree with that.</li>
<li>In this talk, the security features of <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a> service mesh were presented.</li>
<li>Istio can establish a mutually authenticated TLS connections between your microservices, without the need to change your application code. It solves the problem of bootstrapping the TLS trust for you by establishing a custom CA.</li>
<li>Istio Ingress can expose the microservice outside of the service mesh.</li>
<li>Istio Egress controls which external hosts (hosts outside of the service mesh) your microservices can talk to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost-effective Compute Clusters with Spot and Pre-emptible Instances</strong>

<ul>
<li>Quote: <em>Kubernetes is going to make spot instances mainstream</em>.</li>
<li>What applications work well with spot instances? Elastic/bursting applications, HPC workloads, HA cluster apps and horizontally scalable apps.</li>

    <link href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/10/18/aws-lambda-adapter-for-vert-dot-x-web-applications/"/>
    <updated>2017-10-18T23:09:33-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/10/18/aws-lambda-adapter-for-vert-dot-x-web-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a> is an awesome tool-kit for developing reactive microservices. In this article, I&rsquo;m going to present an adapter that allows you to run your Vert.x web service as a Lambda function on AWS.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/vertx_logo.png" width="130" height="130"></p>

<p>If you are creating web services using Vert.x, you are leveraging the HTTP server built into the core of the Vert.x tool-kit. This HTTP server is based on the <a href="https://netty.io/">Netty</a> framework. When your web service comes up, the HTTP server opens a network port and starts listening for the incoming client connections. After a client connects, the HTTP server reads the HTTP request and processes this request by invoking callbacks that you registered. HTTP response generated by your implementation is returned back to the client. The web service remains running and processing requests until you shut it down.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/aws_lambda_logo.png" width="100" height="100"></p>

<p>In contrast to the constantly running web service, an AWS Lambda function is instantiated to serve a single HTTP request. After the HTTP request has been processed, the Lambda function is torn down.</p>

<p>In our company, we&rsquo;re looking at deploying our web services on-premise and in the cloud. We realized that when deploying into AWS it would be more cost effective if we could run some of our web services as Lambda functions. The question was, how to allow a Vert.x web service to alternatively run as a Lambda function? And how to accomplish this with a minimum development and maintenance effort?</p>

<p>After browsing through the Vert.x source code, it occurred to me that it would be possible to write a simple adapter that would convert HTTP requests and responses between the Lambda API and the Vert.x API. I then get on with the job and implemented such an adapter. And because software practitioners love open source, you can find this adapter along with the sample application on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/noseka1/vertx-aws-lambda">vertx-aws-lambda</a>.</p>

<p>As always, I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback. What do you think about this project? Feel free to leave your comments below.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Evaluating Application Metrics Solutions - Prometheus?]]></title>
    <link href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/09/10/evaluating-application-metrics-solutions-prometheus/"/>
    <updated>2017-09-10T16:17:49-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/09/10/evaluating-application-metrics-solutions-prometheus</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA-based</a> application, the problem of application metrics hasn&rsquo;t been solved yet. We would like to have our application services expose metrics that could be used for monitoring, auto-scaling and analytics. In this blog post, I would like to present to you one of the proposals to solve the application metrics which suggests leveraging <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our application consists of multiple services that are deployed on multiple machines. Currently, our applicaton is deployed on-premise or as a managed offering on the virtual machines in AWS. We&rsquo;re also working on containerizing the application services to achieve higher density and better manageability when deploying into the AWS cloud. Some of our services are so light-weight that we&rsquo;re going to turn them into Lambda functions in the future to further reduce the operational costs. Thus, a solution for application metrics should be able to work in the serverless environment, too.</p>

<p>As of now, we deploy <a href="https://www.icinga.com/">Icinga</a> along with our application to provide system-level monitoring. Icinga collects the information about the nodes and checks that our services are still running. However, we don&rsquo;t collect any application-level metrics that would allow us to better assess the performance of our system. For example, we would like to know how many requests are processed per second, average request latency, request error rate, what are the depths of the internal queues and so forth. Application metrics would be a welcome input to the auto-scaling decisions and we would like to feed them into our analytics engine as well.</p>

<h2>Getting to know Prometheus</h2>

<p><img class="right" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/prometheus_logo.png" width="130" height="130"></p>

<p>Before jumping in and implementing our own solution for metrics collection and perhaps reinventing the wheel we started shopping around. It seemed to us, that Prometheus monitoring solution was gaining a lot of momentum in recent times. So, we took a closer look at Prometheus and this is what we found:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prometheus is an open-source monitoring solution hosted by <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">CNCF</a> - a foundation that hosts Kubernetes as well. Many companies use and contribute to Prometheus.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/">architecture</a> of Prometheus is easy to understand and is modular. While Prometheus provides modules for metrics collection, alerts and Web UI, we would not have to use all of them.</li>
<li>Prometheus is a pull-based monitoring system. Each monitored target has to expose Prometheus formatted metrics. By default, targets make the metrics endpoint available at <a href="http://target/metrics.">http://target/metrics.</a> Prometheus periodically scrapes the metrics exposed by the targets.</li>
<li>Our services would need to expose the application metrics in the <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/">Prometheus format</a>. There are actually two formats available: a simple text format and protobufs. There are instrumentation <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/">libraries</a> for Java, C++ and other languages, to gather the metrics and expose them in the Prometheus format.</li>
<li>The text-based Prometheus metrics format is so simple that it could be collected by other monitoring systems like Nagios or Icinga. Exposing metrics in the Prometheus format doesn&rsquo;t really mandate using Prometheus server for monitoring.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a Prometheus <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter">jmx_exporter</a> library to convert the JMX MBeans data into Prometheus format. This would come in handy for gathering Tomcat metrics, for example.</li>
<li><a href="http://metrics.dropwizard.io/">Dropwizard metrics</a> is a popular Java instrumentation library. For instance, Vert.x toolkit can report its <a href="http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-dropwizard-metrics/java/">internal metrics</a> using the Dropwizard metrics library and there are other frameworks that supports it. Prometheus comes with a <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/tree/master/simpleclient_dropwizard">simpleclient_dropwizard</a> library that can make Dropwizard metrics available to Prometheus monitoring.</li>
<li>To prevent unauthorized access, the metric targets would need to be protected using TLS in combination with client certs, bearer token or HTTP basic authentication.</li>
<li>Prometheus pulls the metrics from the monitored targets. In addition, Prometheus comes with a <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/">Pushgateway</a> where clients can push their metrics to. However, as noted in the Prometheus documentation: <em>Usually, the only valid use case for the Pushgateway is for capturing the outcome of a service-level batch job</em>. Hence, Pushgateway would not work for aggregating metrics pushed by the Lambda functions.</li>
<li>In addition to application-level metrics, system-level metrics can be collected by Prometheus as well thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter">node_exporter</a>.</li>
<li>Prometheus is a great fit for dynamic environments like clouds and container clusters due to its discovery capabilities. In AWS, operator attaches tags to VMs and based on that Prometheus can discover them and start monitoring them automatically. The same principle works for container clusters like Kubernetes, too. One has to add annotations to pods and Prometheus will discover them automatically.</li>
<li>Prometheus makes the collected metrics available for querying via an <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/querying/api/">HTTP API</a>. We could retrieve the metrics using this API in order to feed them into our analytics engine.</li>
<li>There is a great <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/">guide</a> that would help us when designing our custom metrics.</li>
<li>Prometheus is written in Go and comes in a form of statically-linked binaries. This makes the installation of Prometheus a breeze.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Instrumenting Java applications</h2>

<p>In order to gather application metrics and to make them available to the Prometheus monitoring system, we would need to instrument our application services using Prometheus libraries. To get a clear idea, we created a proof-of-concept Java application instrumented using Prometheus. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/noseka1/prometheus-poc">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we are thinking about leveraging Dropwizard metrics library for instrumentation. The Dropwizard metrics library is rather popular and is not connected with any particular monitoring solution. We would still be able to expose the Dropwizard metrics to Prometheus using a wrapper <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/tree/master/simpleclient_dropwizard">simpleclient_dropwizard</a>.</p>

<h2>Monitoring AWS Lambda functions</h2>

<p>AWS Lambda functions are extremely short-lived processes. Prometheus won&rsquo;t be able to pull the application metrics from them. Instead, Lambdas will have to push their metrics to Prometheus. At the first glance, we thought that the Prometheus Pushgateway could help here, however, reading the Pushgateway&rsquo;s documentation more carefully we found that <em>the Pushgateway is explicitly not an aggregator or distributed counter but rather a metrics cache</em>. And that&rsquo;s a problem, as we would like to count how many Lambda instances are being invoked per second and so on.</p>

<p>At the moment, we can see two approaches how to make the monitoring of Lambda functions work with Prometheus. Either, push the application metrics from the Lambda functions using a StatsD client. Prometheus&#8217; <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter">statsd_exporter</a> would play a role of a StastD server and make the metrics available to Prometheus. Or, the second approach would be to create our own metrics aggregator that would receive the metrics from Lambda functions in the Prometheus format, aggregate them and expose them to the Prometheus server.</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Besides using Prometheus, we were also thinking about other solutions for application metrics. As we already deploy Icinga for the system-level monitoring, it would make sense to use it for application metrics, too. We really like Icinga, it&rsquo;s a great monitoring software. Unfortunately, Icinga is based on the node and services model where a statically configured set of nodes are running services on them. This doesn&rsquo;t really fit with the modern containerized deployments where containers are dynamically scheduled on the cluster nodes and are also scaled up and down. Also, Prometheus server supports all sorts of metric queries and aggregations. Icinga is lacking this feature altogether. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re leaning towards replacing Icinga with Prometheus for system-level as well as application-level monitoring.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hawkular.org/">Hawkular</a> seems to be another modern monitoring project we would like to take a closer look at. In contrast to Prometheus project which is developed by many parties, it seems that Hawkular project is mostly driven by Red Hat.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Prometheus is a modern monitoring system. It was the first system we evaluated as we were trying to find a good solution for application metrics. In addition to application-level metrics, we could use Prometheus to collect system-level metrics as well. This would make Prometheus a single monitoring solution for our application. The only bigger issue for us is the absence of the AWS Lambda monitoring story.</p>

<p>If you have an application that you deliver on-premise as well as in the cloud, how did you solve the application metrics collection and monitoring? Is Prometheus a good way to go? Please, leave your comments below.</p>

    <updated>2017-09-03T22:47:06-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/09/03/ansible-certification-ex407</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I passed the Red Hat certification exam <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex407-red-hat-certificate-expertise-ansible-automation">EX407 Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Ansible Automation</a>. In this blog post, I&rsquo;d like to share some of my experience with you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/ansible_logo.png" width="80" height="80"></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/redhat_logo.png" width="130" height="130"></p>

<p>In addition to the Ansible certification, Red Hat offers a certification for Puppet as well, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex405-red-hat-certificate-expertise-configuration-management-puppet">EX405 Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Configuration Management with Puppet</a>. I was using Puppet in the years 2008/2009. Back then, Puppet was a state of the art configuration management tool that did a great job for us. However, later on Ansible showed up and I quickly realized that the problems that we were solving with Puppet could have been more easily solved with Ansible. In our company, we switched from Puppet to Ansible in 2014 and have never looked back. As I gained much more experience using Ansible, I decided to go for the Ansible certification. For you, perhaps the Puppet certification would be more interesting.</p>

<p>It is the way of testing, that makes the Red Hat certification exams so enjoyable for me. Red Hat certification exams are purely practical. In the exam, you&rsquo;ll be given a list of requirements and an access to one or more virtual machines. Your goal is to configure the virtual machines based on the requirements.</p>

<p>The Ansible exam focused on writing Ansible playbooks, working with Ansible inventories including dynamic inventories, running ad-hoc Ansible commands, leveraging Ansible facts, creating Jinja2 templates, error handling, playbook tags, downloading a role from Ansible Galaxy and using Ansible vault to secure passwords.</p>

<p>To prepare for the exam, I used the online course Automation with Ansible I (DO407R) that is included in my <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription">Red Hat Learning Subscription</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, I didn&rsquo;t find the exam too difficult. There were 4 hours of time provided for the exam. I was able to complete all my tasks 1 hour and 20 minutes before the exam end while reaching the maximum score of 300 points.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve kept reading my blog post until this point, here are three basic exam tips for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the <code>ansible-playbook --limit</code> parameter, to try out your playbook against a single host first before applying it to all your hosts.</li>
<li>Make sure you can run Ansible modules as ad-hoc commands. They can come handy when you want to undo the effects of running an erroneous playbook.</li>
<li>Use <code>ansible-doc --list</code> to look up a module that can achieve your goal and <code>ansible-doc &lt;module&gt;</code> to learn about the module parameters and example usage.</li>
</ol>


<p>Passing the Ansible exam brought me to the rank of Red Hat Certified Architect Level II. The current list of my Red Hat certifications can be found on the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=160-216-727">Verify a Red Hat Certified Professional</a> website.</p>

<p>Are you working on your Red Hat certification and would like to share your experience? I would always like to hear from you! Feel free to leave your comments below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Did you decide to dockerize your application? Awesome! Are you looking for a place to build and host your Docker containers? OpenShift Online is a service that allows you to build and run your Docker containers. Read on, if you want to learn more about it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><a href="https://manage.openshift.com/">OpenShift Online</a> is a Platform-as-a-Service cloud managed by Red Hat. It is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). OpenShift Online is a multi-tenant offering. That means that containers owned by different tenants are running on the same cluster. If you&rsquo;re more interested in renting your own private OpenShift cluster, you shall consider the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/index.html">OpenShift Dedicated</a> offering, instead.</p>

<p>The information about the plans and pricing of the OpenShift Online service can be found <a href="https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html">here</a>. In this blog post, we&rsquo;re going to utilize the free of charge <em>Starter</em> plan. With this plan, you get 1GiB of memory for your containers, another 1GiB of memory for running builds, deployments and jobs, and finally 1GiB of persistent storage. The real limitation of the free <em>Starter</em> plan is the resource hibernation. Your containers will be forced to sleep 18 hours in a 72 hour period.</p>

<h2>Welcome to OpenShift Online</h2>

<p>You can login into OpenShift Online <a href="https://manage.openshift.com/">here</a>. If you don&rsquo;t have an OpenShift account, the sign up and creation of the OpenShift account doesn&rsquo;t take you long. After you login into your OpenShift account, find a small question mark icon in the top right corner of the welcome page. From the drop down menu choose the &ldquo;Command Line Tools&rdquo; option.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/openshift_online/openshift_online_welcome.png"></p>

<p>Download the <code>oc</code> client tool using one of the provided download links. We&rsquo;re going to use the <code>oc</code> tool throughout this tutorial. After downloading the distribution archive, extract the <code>oc</code> tool from it and place it somewhere on your PATH. The <code>oc</code> tool is a single statically linked binary which makes the installation straight forward. On the same page, notice the instructions on how to login into the CLI. We&rsquo;ll be logging into it in a moment.</p>

<p>Go back to the welcome page and this time choose the &ldquo;About&rdquo; option from the drop down menu in the top right corner. On the &ldquo;About&rdquo; page, you can learn that OpenShift Online is built upon a fairly recent version of OpenShift. That&rsquo;s great to know, as each new version of OpenShift comes with a ton of new features. As the OpenShift Online user you would not like to be left behind with an older version of OpenShift.</p>

<p>On the same &ldquo;About&rdquo; page, you can find the address of the integrated Docker registry. You can push ready images to this registry in order to make them available for deployment on OpenShift. If you build images on OpenShift, the finished images will be pushed into this registry at the end of the build process. In addition to deploying images from the integrated Docker registry, you can, of course, deploy images directly from the Docker Hub as well.</p>

<h2>Getting our hands dirty</h2>

<p>In this section, we&rsquo;re going to use the CLI tool to exercise the OpenShift Online functionality. From the &ldquo;Command Line Tools&rdquo; page that we visited previously, copy the command to login into the CLI tool:</p>

<p>Note that the value of your login token will differ. Next, let&rsquo;s create a new OpenShift project called <code>php-hello</code>:</p>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>to build a new example application in Ruby.
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The Starter plan allows you to create only a single project. Next, we&rsquo;re going to build our PHP application. The source code of the application can be found at <a href="https://github.com/noseka1/openshift-php-hello">GitHub</a>. The whole purpose of the application is to return a Hello message containing the name of the host that the application is running on. You can build the application using the <code>oc new-build</code> command:</p>

<p>OpenShift automatically detects, that we&rsquo;re building a PHP application and will use an appropriate build image. The build image contains a pre-installed Apache server with mod_php. During the build, the <code>index.php</code> file from the source code repository is copied into the document root of the Apache server. The build process takes a minute or two to complete. You can follow the progress of your build using the <code>oc logs</code> command:</p>

<p>The output of the build is a new <code>openshift-php-hello</code> Docker image. This image is automatically pushed into the integrated Docker registry by OpenShift. In the next step, we&rsquo;re going to create a DeploymentConfig file which describes how to deploy our brand new <code>openshift-php-hello</code> image on OpenShift. Create a file named <code>php-hello.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

<p>Submit this file to OpenShift in order to launch the deployment:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>oc create -f php-hello.yml
</span><span class='line'>deploymentconfig <span class="s2">&quot;php-hello&quot;</span> created
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Based on the DeploymentConfig descriptor, OpenShift will start one container <code>php-hello-1-XXXXX</code>. You can check whether the container is running with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc get pod
</span><span class='line'>NAME                          READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span class='line'>openshift-php-hello-1-build   0/1       Completed   <span class="m">0</span>          2h
</span><span class='line'>php-hello-1-zw48t             1/1       Running     <span class="m">0</span>          2m
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Verify that the <code>READY</code> column for your <code>php-hello</code> container eventually reads <code>1/1</code>. This indicates, that the deployment was successful and your container is running. In the following steps, we&rsquo;re going to configure OpenShift routing to allow the external network traffic to reach our container. For further information about the traffic routing on OpenShift, you can refer to my older blog post <a href="http://alesnosek.com/blog/2017/02/14/accessing-kubernetes-pods-from-outside-of-the-cluster/">Accessing Kubernetes Pods from Outside of the Cluster</a>. First, let&rsquo;s create a service for our <code>php-hello</code> container:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc expose dc php-hello --port 8080
</span><span class='line'>service <span class="s2">&quot;php-hello&quot;</span> exposed
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The created service functions as a internal load balancer. It forwards the traffic to the <code>php-hello</code> container on port 8080. The internal IP address of this load balancer is <code>172.30.80.50</code>, as we can learn when listing the existing services:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc get svc
</span><span class='line'>NAME        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT<span class="o">(</span>S<span class="o">)</span>    AGE
</span><span class='line'>php-hello   172.30.80.50   &lt;none&gt;        8080/TCP   4s
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, we&rsquo;re going to create a route which will forward the external traffic to our service and hence to our <code>php-hello</code> container:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc expose svc php-hello
</span><span class='line'>route <span class="s2">&quot;php-hello&quot;</span> exposed
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The route is assigned a public FQDN <code>php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com</code>. As we haven&rsquo;t configured the route to use the TLS protocol, our application will be reachable on the standard HTTP port 80. The assigned FQDN can be found in the output of the <code>oc get route</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc get route
</span><span class='line'>NAME        HOST/PORT                                                      PATH      SERVICES    PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
</span><span class='line'>php-hello   php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com             php-hello   <span class="m">8080</span>                    None
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this moment, our application should be reachable over the public Internet. Let&rsquo;s send an HTTP request to our application:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com
</span><span class='line'>Hello from php-hello-1-zw48t!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Excellent, the application responded with the Hello message as expected. In the last exercise of our tutorial, we&rsquo;re going to scale our application. Let&rsquo;s ask OpenShift to create one more <code>php-hello</code> container:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc scale dc php-hello --replicas 2
</span><span class='line'>deploymentconfig <span class="s2">&quot;php-hello&quot;</span> scaled
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The deployment of the second container will complete shortly. You can check the status of running containers using the <code>oc get pod</code> commmand:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>oc get pod
</span><span class='line'>NAME                          READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
</span><span class='line'>openshift-php-hello-1-build   0/1       Completed   <span class="m">0</span>          2h
</span><span class='line'>php-hello-1-cl5nw             1/1       Running     <span class="m">0</span>          30s
</span><span class='line'>php-hello-1-zw48t             1/1       Running     <span class="m">0</span>          21m
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point, we&rsquo;re having two Docker containers ready to serve our HTTP requests. Let&rsquo;s generate some traffic and observe how OpenShift load balances the incoming requests between the two containers:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com
</span><span class='line'>Hello from php-hello-1-zw48t!
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com
</span><span class='line'>Hello from php-hello-1-cl5nw!
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com
</span><span class='line'>Hello from php-hello-1-zw48t!
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>curl php-hello-php-hello.a3c1.starter-us-west-1.openshiftapps.com
</span><span class='line'>Hello from php-hello-1-cl5nw!
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you migrating your existing application to the cloud? Are you missing a solution for centralized configuration management? Read on to learn, how we implemented centralized configuration management on top of our existing application and got it ready for the cloud.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Our existing application is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA-based</a> application, i.e an application consisting of multiple services that communicate with each other and that are deployed across multiple nodes. Services are configured using configuration files located on the local filesystem. Currently, the operator has to edit multiple configuration files across multiple nodes by hand. In addition to that, for the sake of performance and redundancy, there are multiple instances of each service deployed behind a load balancer. This increases the configuration burden even further as the operator has to keep the configuration files consistent across several instances of the same service.</p>

<p>With the growing number of services and the need to deploy our application into dynamic cloud environments, a centralized configuration management became a necessity.</p>

<h2>Looking for a solution</h2>

<p>It would be possible to leverage the standard DevOps tools like Puppet, Chef or Ansible to manage the configuration files on each of the deployed nodes. For bare metal deployments or when deploying on virtual machines in the cloud, these tools could do a decent job. However, on our way to the cloud, weâ€™re looking at containerizing all of our services. Furthermore, down the road we would also like to leverage serverless architecture as well. For updating a handful of configuration files inside of a Docker container, Puppet, Chef or Ansible just seem too heavy. Needless to say that these tools would not be usable when considering serverless architecture.</p>

<p>When searching for a solution, we came across the <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd">confd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template">consul-template</a> projects. Both tools are based on the same principle. First, the values of the configuration options are persisted in a backend store. While consul-template can store values in Consul only, confd supports a host of different backends like Consul, etcd, Redis or DynamoDB. Second, a set of templates on the filesystem is populated with the values from the backend store and hence forming valid configuration files. These configuration files are then consumed by the application. We drew a great deal of inspiration from this approach.</p>

<h2>Our approach</h2>

<p>Our centralized configuration management consists of two components: <em>CCS</em> (Centralized Configuration Store) which is a Consul cluster holding the configuration data, and <em>CCT</em> (Centralized Configuration Tool) which is a command-line client. CCT implements two functions. First, it allows the operator to query and modify the configuration values persisted in CCS. Second, it syncs up the configuration files on the local filesystem with their state in CCS. The following diagram depicts the components involved in the centralized configuration management:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://alesnosek.com/images/posts/centralized_configuration_management.png"></p>

<p>In addition to the configuration values, the CCS component also stores all the additional data that is needed to completely recreate a given configuration file on the local filesystem. For instance, in the case of an ini file, CCS stores the absolute file path, file owner, file group, file mode, sections of the ini file, ini options with their values and all comment lines. Each ini option is also assigned a type or a set of allowed values and any configuration changes made by the operator are checked against the type information before they are accepted.</p>

<p>Apart from the ini file format, Java properties and XML files are also supported. The configuration management verifies that the XML file either conforms to a specific XML schema or is well-formed, before it is accepted. Lastly, all other configuration files that are not parsed by the configuration management are marked as &ldquo;unmanaged&rdquo; and the entire content of such a file is stored under a single key in the key-value store in Consul.</p>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s review an example scenario where an operator wants to modify a configuration of a specific service. The individual steps are depicted in the diagram above:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Using the CCT command-line client, the operator obtains a list of configuration files for a specific service managed by CCS. The operator uses CCT to edit the selected configuration file. CCT fetches all the data from CCS that are required to recreate the configuration file and presents it to the operator for editing (for example by opening the file in the operator&rsquo;s favorite editor).</p></li>
<li><p>After the operator made changes to the configuration file, the CCT parses the file to find out which values have been modified. The modified values are checked for corectness by CCT before they are saved in CCS.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon request, CCT fetches the configuration data from CCS in order to use it in the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>CCT syncs up the configuration files on the local filesystem with the data fetched from CCS.</p></li>
<li><p>The new configuration takes effect after the respective service has been restarted by the operator.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Overall, CCS is a single source of truth for the application configuration. This is in contrast with the confd or consul-template approach where the configuration values are stored in the backend while the templates are stored on the filesystem. When a new release of the application is deployed, having all configuration data in one place makes the upgrade of the configuration data easier.</p>

<h2>Future directions</h2>

<p>It was important to us to introduce the centralized configuration management into our existing application without breaking the existing operational workflows. For example, operators should be able to edit the configuration files as they did in the previous versions of our application. Also, as the configuration files are written to the filesystem, the existing services continue to work without any modification from the previous versions. Hence the centralized configuration management can be deployed as a truly optional component on top of the existing application.</p>

<p>In the future, when some of our services will be deployed as (Lambda) functions in the serverless environment, those services will need to fetch their configuration by directly contacting CCS. However, nothing will change from the operator&rsquo;s standpoint. The operator will continue editing configuration files even when those won&rsquo;t exist on any filesystem anymore.</p>
